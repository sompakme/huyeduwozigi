And while the Disney Channel has given us plenty of successful Hollywood stars over the years — it is not the only way for young actors to rise to fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Are Known For Having Fun With Makeup" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Are Known For Having Fun With Makeup</a></span></p><p>Today's list takes a look at some big names in Hollywood who rose to fame before turning 18 and they were never on the Disney Channel. From Hollywood legends such as Natalie Portman and Drew Barrymore to famous siblings like Dakota and Elle Fanning and the Olsen twins — keep on scrolling to see just which celebs rose to fame as child stars!</p><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Millie Bobby Brown</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is 16-year-old Millie Bobby Brown who rose to fame as Eleven on the Netflix sci-fi show Stranger Things which premiered in 2016. At the time, the actress was only 12 and she quickly became one of the most promising young stars in Hollywood. Since Stranger Things premiered, Millie Bobby Brown <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has been up to quite a lot</a> and there is no doubt that the future still holds plenty of acting for this young star!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dakota-and-elle-fanning><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dakota And Elle Fanning</span></h2><p>Next on the list are sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning who both had their acting debut in the drama movie I Am Sam in 2001. In it, Dakota — who was seven at the time — played Lucy Dawson, and her younger sister Elle — who was only three at the time — played a younger version of her sister's character. After that, both ladies ended up having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a very busy childhood</a> and today 26-year-old Dakota and 22-year-old Elle are certainly staple names in the industry.</p><h2 id=mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen</span></h2><p>Speaking of siblings — next on the list are twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen who rose to fame as babies when they had their acting debut by playing Michelle Tanner on the popular late '80s sitcom Full House.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs Who Are Turning 25 This Year" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Are Turning 25 This Year</a></span></p><p>Since then, the twins have become major child stars who released plenty of successful movies throughout their teens. However, Mary-Kate and Ashley have given up acting and today the ladies <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">are doing other things instead</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Drew Barrymore</span></h2><p>Another Hollywood star who rose to fame at a very early age is Drew Barrymore. Drew had her film debut in the 1980s sci-fi horror Altered States but her first well-known role was her portrayal of Gertie in Steven Spielberg’s 1982 sci-fi movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Honestly, the rest is history as Drew went on to star in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of Hollywood blockbusters</a> all throughout her career!</p><h2 id=iain-armitage><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Iain Armitage</span></h2><p>Next on the list is 12-year-old actor Iain Armitage who is best known for his starring role as Sheldon Cooper in the sitcom show Young Sheldon, as well as Ziggy Chapman in HBO's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drama show Big Little Lies</a>. Ian — who rose to fame at the age of nine — is certainly bound to be an even more famous actor as he grows up!</p><h2 id=natalie-portman><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Natalie Portman</span></h2><p>Let's move on to Academy Award winner Natalie Portman who began her acting career at the age of 12 when she portrayed Mathilda in the 1994 action thriller movie Léon: The Professional. Since then, Natalie has had an impressive career — and nowadays she is considered one of the most talented actresses in the industry as she starred in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of critically acclaimed movies</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amandla-stenberg><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Amandla Stenberg</span></h2><p>Another famous child star that made it onto today’s list is Amandla Stenberg. The actress made her debut in the 2011 action thriller movie Colombiana when she was 14 years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="10 Pairs Of Celebs Who Share Their Birthday" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Pairs Of Celebs Who Share Their Birthday</a></span></p><p>Amandla rose to international fame a year later as Rue in the 2012 dystopian sci-fi movie The Hunger Games and since then the young actress — who is now 22 — had a quite impressive career!</p><h2 id=macaulay-culkin><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Macaulay Culkin</span></h2><p>This list would certainly not be complete without Macaulay Culkin who rose to fame as Kevin McCallister in the 1990s comedy movie Home Alone. Prior to that role, Macaulay had roles in a couple of movies and his actual acting debut was as Cy Blue Black in the 1988 drama movie Rocket Gibraltar when the actor was only eight years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-paquin><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Anna Paquin</span></h2><p>While many may think that Anna Paquin rose to international fame as Sookie Stackhouse in the HBO vampire drama show True Blood in 2008 — that is not true. The actress actually had her acting debut as Flora McGrath in the 1993 romantic drama movie The Piano — and for that role, she even received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Yes, at the time Anna was only 11 years old!</p><h2 id=and-lastly-daniel-radcliff-emma-watson-and-rupert-grint><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Lastly, Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, And Rupert Grint</span></h2><p>Wrapping the list up are nonother than Daniel Radcliffe, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Watson</a>, and Rupert Grint. The three actors rose to fame as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley in the popular Harry Potter movie franchise. When the first movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone premiered in 2001 Daniel was 11, Emma was 10, and Rupert was 12 years old!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Celebs You Probably Didn't Know Were On Broadway" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs You Probably Didn't Know Were On Broadway</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyfp8Buw8eoZKuno5p6tbuMn5imnV2Xsqe70Z5kra2io7avs4xqb2amn6l6sLqMrZ%2BeZZSewK%2Bx2GaaoZmeo7Ktew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html&text=10%20Actors%20Who%20Rose%20To%20Fame%20Before%20Turning%2018%20%28Not%20On%20The%20Disney%20Channel%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html&title=10%20Actors%20Who%20Rose%20To%20Fame%20Before%20Turning%2018%20%28Not%20On%20The%20Disney%20Channel%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html&title=10%20Actors%20Who%20Rose%20To%20Fame%20Before%20Turning%2018%20%28Not%20On%20The%20Disney%20Channel%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html&title=10%20Actors%20Who%20Rose%20To%20Fame%20Before%20Turning%2018%20%28Not%20On%20The%20Disney%20Channel%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-actors-who-rose-to-fame-before-turning-18-not-on-the-disney-channel.html&description=10%20Actors%20Who%20Rose%20To%20Fame%20Before%20Turning%2018%20%28Not%20On%20The%20Disney%20Channel%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amazon-s-ceo-andy-jassy-earned-212-million-in-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amazons CEO Andy Jassy Earned $212 Million In 2021">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./there-s-a-right-way-to-f-ck-with-a-kardashian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Theres A Right Way To F*ck With A Kardashian">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
