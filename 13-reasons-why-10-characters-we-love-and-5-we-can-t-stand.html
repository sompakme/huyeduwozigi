He stands up against bullies all the time in order to fight for what is right. If he knew what Hannah was going through, he would’ve been there to talk her off the ledge. He would have been there to make sure she overcame her pain.</p><h2 id=we-love-tony-because-he-was-hannah-s-only-true-friend><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>We Love Tony Because He Was Hannah's Only True Friend</span></h2><p class=p1>Tony Padilla is another excellent character from 13 Reasons Why that we totally love.

He assaulted multiple girls at his high school and didn’t seem to feel remorseful or regretful about it until the very end. He ended up getting murdered because of the atrocious actions that he took against so many different girls.</p><h2 id=we-love-jessica-because-she-is-a-strong-survivor><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>We Love Jessica Because She Is A Strong Survivor</span></h2><p class=p1>We totally love Jessica! She is a strong survivor and she spoke up in a courtroom full of other people, even though it was extremely hard for her to do that. A lot of people who have gone through assault find it difficult and challenging to come forward and tell the truth about the situation, but she was brave and strong enough to do that.</p><h2 id=we-love-justin-because-he-s-overcome-much-adversity><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>We Love Justin Because He's Overcome Much Adversity</span></h2><p>Justin Foley is an awesome character who has overcome a lot of adversity.

The biggest mistake that he made was making a list titled “hot or not”. The list objectified girls at his high school and he knew that it was a mean thing to do. He was remorseful.</p><h2 id=we-love-tyler-because-he-s-a-strong-survivor><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>We Love Tyler Because He's A Strong Survivor</span></h2><p class=p1>We love Tyler because just like Jessica, he is another strong survivor.

It seemed like she was always wrapped up in other people’s drama and other people’s issues. Viewers often wondered why she didn’t take a step back and stay out of everyone else’s business for once. She was always stirring up trouble or getting stuck in the middle of a problem.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Questions That Need To Be Answered In 13 Reasons Why, Season 4</a></span></p><h2 id=we-love-zach-because-he-was-there-for-hannah><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>We Love Zach Because He Was There For Hannah</span></h2><p class=p1>We easily have so much love for Zach because he was there for Hannah while she was still alive. Yes, he stole the encouragement notes from her classroom box but after that, they were able to develop a healthy and strong friendship where he was there for her. They were even able to be romantic with each other! He is played by Ross Butler who also briefly starred on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Riverdale</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-love-sheri-because-she-stepped-up-to-make-up-for-her-mistakes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>We Love&nbsp;Sheri Because She Stepped Up To Make Up For Her Mistakes</span></h2><p class=p1>We love Sheri because she stepped up to make up for her past mistakes.

At the same time, we also don’t like the fact that Hannah decided to end her own life. She decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">end her own life</a> based on temporary circumstances. She acted as if high school was going to be forever. If she waited a few more years until college, she would have realized that life gets so much better after high school.</p><h2 id=we-can-t-stand-seth-because-he-harms-justin><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>We Can't Stand Seth Because He Harms Justin</span></h2><p>We can’t stand Seth because he was always very abusive with Justin.
