Sometimes, the best love stories are about professional respect and friendship, instead of passionate Hollywood romance - such is the case for these two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both actors got their starts and earned their fame as key players on major television shows in the 1990s. Aniston became famous because of&nbsp;Friends and Sandler became a household name through his work on Saturday Night Live.</p><p>The two stars quickly became megastars who were known for their memorable roles, although Sandler is perhaps better known for his comedic talents. These shared experiences, along with being around the same age and enjoying the benefits and pitfalls of being superstars for more than 25 years, have certainly helped them to cement their friendship.</p><p>Recent promotional activities for their film,&nbsp;Murder Mystery, and the mutual appreciation the duo have shown for one another during award season, have everyone talking about this comedic 'odd couple'.</p><p>Here are 15 sweet things fans don't know about Jennifer Aniston’s and Adam Sandler's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=award-speech-shout-outs><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Award Speech Shout Outs</span></h2><p>Making it into someone’s award speech is a pretty big deal. One of the people who Aniston has been sure to pay tribute to, from the award winner’s podium, is her friend, Adam Sandler.</p><p>Jennifer used her speech to call attention to Sandler’s amazing performance as a gambling addict in the film,&nbsp;Uncut Gems. Despite getting wonderful reviews, that film has been snubbed in terms of award nominations.</p><p>Jennifer said, “Oh, Adam Sandler your performance is extraordinary. Your magic is real, buddy. I love you."</p><h2 id=jen-shows-the-love-in-interviews><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Jen Shows The Love In Interviews</span></h2><p>Jen shared that she met Adam more than 30 years ago, at an industry event, and their friendship developed from there.</p><p>Aniston has said of Sandler, “We like acting together, I always feel alive during every scene. We have a great time together.”</p><p>While everyone loves to celebrate Aniston’s friendships with her fellow Friends, her friendship with Sandler is equally important to her, personally and professionally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-loves-working-with-jen><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Adam Loves Working With Jen</span></h2><p>While actors sometimes save all their chemistry for their film or TV scenes, you can usually tell during interviews if the ‘magic’ you’re seeing in a film is simply good acting, rather than real-life chemistry.</p><p>With Aniston and Sandler, it’s clear they genuinely love working together. Sandler said “She’s just a good friend of mine and a nice person. I had dinner with her a couple nights ago. She’s just funny as hell. I love her.”</p><h2 id=jen-thinks-he-s-a-good-kisser><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Jen Thinks He's A Good Kisser</span></h2><p>Jen likes to joke about the times she and Adam shared romantic moments onscreen. Both have talked about Jen sending text messages counting down the days until the big 'lip-lock' scene. Because both have been in the industry for so long, and have a lot of experience with stage kisses, it’s just another day’s work.</p><h2 id=what-his-wife-thinks-of-their-friendship><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>What His Wife Thinks Of Their Friendship</span></h2><p>Adam Sandler has previously talked <i>to </i>Ellen DeGeneres&nbsp;about his wife’s lack of jealousy when it comes to his romantic onscreen scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adam said, "There's no jealousy at all. She's just like, 'Get in there!'" Apparently, Sandler has said that Jackie has critiqued her husband’s online lip-locking skills, telling him, "Just please, for the sake of women, get in there and just look a little more alive."</p><p>With Jackie (his wife) being on the set with a role in the film, Murder Mystery, Sandler told the Associated Press, "The only awkward part is hearing my wife on the side going, 'Harder! Harder! Kiss her harder! Deeper!'"</p><h2 id=playing-parodies-of-themselves><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Playing Parodies Of Themselves</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler are two of the best-known, wealthiest celebrities out there. That being said, one of the reasons they enjoy working with each other is that they aren’t afraid to poke fun at their own lives of privilege.</p><p>In Murder Mystery, (SPOILER ALERT) they play a broke couple who gush over celebs, completely starstruck. They are enamored with tabloids and try to sneak into first class, only to be kicked out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=platonic-affections><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Platonic Affections</span></h2><p>When people are secure in their relationships, they are confident enough to show how much they care through words and in terms of physical affection.</p><p>Because they have known each other for so long, and because Jackie Sandler is so supportive of their relationship, they don’t need to worry about giving each other a hug or even holding hands in public.</p><p>Even if the paparazzi snap a photo, no one who really matters in their lives is going to take offense.</p><h2 id=showing-support-together><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Showing Support Together</span></h2><p>During an interview, Jennifer Aniston was happy to share her kind words about her co-star, Adam Sandler.</p><p>When asked what makes Sandler presenting her with an award so special, Aniston answered, "I've literally known him for 30 years, we're family. Am I crying. He made me tear up out there, Adam doesn't do this kind of stuff so that's why... that's just the true sweetness and friendship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-they-met><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How They Met</span></h2><p>Though they met at an industry breakfast three decades ago, it wasn’t until 2011 that Aniston and Sandler first appeared in a film, Just Go With It, together, although they were close long before they ever shared a screen.</p><p>Aniston has said that it can be difficult to act out a romantic scene with Sandler because she thinks of him like a family member first.</p><h2 id=30-million-people-can-t-be-wrong><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>30 Million People Can't Be Wrong!</span></h2><p>Since Murder Mystery was viewed on more than 30 million Netflix accounts, it was a no-brainer for them to schedule a follow-up film. While the Rotten Tomatoes score of 44 percent is less than stellar, some critics liked it.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> said, “Aniston and Sandler, paired before in 2011's Just Go With It, relax into their roles as if their only stake in Mystery is to enjoy the free trip to Italy and have fun running down cobblestones.”</p><p>Either way, the two are happy to work together again and again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=getting-mushy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Getting Mushy</span></h2><p>When Jennifer was awarded a 2019 People’s Choice Award by presenter Adam Sandler, he had a lot of wonderful things to say about his friend. Quick to call him on his sweet and kind speech, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! Online</a> reported Aniston that responded with, "Adam! When did you get so mushy?! Oh my god, I love this man with all my heart. This is one of the kindest human beings you'll ever meet."</p><h2 id=who-is-worth-more-money><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Who Is Worth More Money?</span></h2><p>Two big shots in Hollywood are bound to be worth a lot of money. Perhaps we can blame the gender pay gap for the fact that Sandler is worth more than Aniston. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth&nbsp;</a> article revealed the “American actress, producer and spokeswoman, (Aniston)&nbsp; has a net worth of $300 million.” The same site says that Sandler is worth a cool 420 million.</p><h2 id=what-years-of-collaboration-look-like><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Years Of Collaboration Look Like?</span></h2><p>If you can’t rib on your friends, who can you rib on? Thanks to friendship, numerous projects, and years in the industry as peers, Sandler can tease his friend along with the rest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The comedian heckled her, telling The Hollywood Reporter he “got better over the years, and I think Jennifer is struggling to stay with my chops, but I think ultimately she’ll get there the next time.”</p><h2 id=most-successful-amp-least-successful-projects><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Most Successful & Least Successful Projects</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston’s most successful projects include Friends (obviously) as well as Bruce Almighty, The Good Girl, and Office Space. Her worst projects include Mac and Me&nbsp;and horror movie, Leprechaun.</p><p>Sandler found success during his SNL stint, and through films like Big Daddy, Grown Ups, Punch Drunk Love, and Funny People. Not so much in projects like Jack and Jill and Don't Mess With The Zohan.</p><p>We’re certain the two celebrate each other’s wins and support each other when projects don’t succeed as they were supposed to.</p><h2 id=what-they-re-working-on-next><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What They're Working On Next</span></h2><p>When asked about working together again, Sandler said, “We always have fun together.” When it comes to Murder Mystery, Sandler admits, “I don’t know 100 percent what the sequel is”, but, “they’re working on it right now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston is still working on The Morning Show, with a film, The Fixer, in pre-production, and Sandler is set for Hotel Transylvania 4, which was just announced. Sandler said, “Jennifer and I are great friends. She works well without me. I’m just glad when she invites me for the ride!”</p><p>Sources: Showbiz Cheat Sheet, Pop Sugar, Daily Mail, In Touch Weekly, USA Today, Nicki Swift, Hello Magazine</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Courtney Cox Are Pushing For A Friends Reunion</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWjrLKmwIytn6Kml6h6p63NrGSdp56peqy6zrBkmpqfqsFutsSnpaKelad6orrIrKuopl2Wu6V5wJ2YpmWjlruluMSrqmaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-sweet-things-fans-don-t-know-about-jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-relationship.html&text=15%20Sweet%20Things%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Know%20About%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20And%20Adam%20Sandler%27s%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-sweet-things-fans-don-t-know-about-jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-sweet-things-fans-don-t-know-about-jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-relationship.html&title=15%20Sweet%20Things%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Know%20About%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20And%20Adam%20Sandler%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-sweet-things-fans-don-t-know-about-jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-relationship.html&title=15%20Sweet%20Things%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Know%20About%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20And%20Adam%20Sandler%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-sweet-things-fans-don-t-know-about-jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-relationship.html&title=15%20Sweet%20Things%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Know%20About%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20And%20Adam%20Sandler%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-sweet-things-fans-don-t-know-about-jennifer-aniston-and-adam-sandler-s-relationship.html&description=15%20Sweet%20Things%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Know%20About%20Jennifer%20Aniston%20And%20Adam%20Sandler%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./angie-hicks-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angie Hicks Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-spectacular-pools-of-the-rich-and-famous.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Spectacular Pools Of The Rich And Famous">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
