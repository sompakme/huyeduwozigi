While Brad has been spotted alone with the kids, their lives are dictated by their mother Angelina Jolie. The announcement of a split after having six kids was astonishing and blew us all away. The two really seemed inseparable!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After meeting in 2004 during the filming of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the two sparked a romance that they denied for a very long time. This led to Pitt leaving his then-wife <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston.</a> The following year, Brad and Jennifer announced that they were splitting after five years of marriage. Three months after the divorce was final, Angelina announced that she was pregnant with Brad’s child (Shiloh). On top of that, Maddox and Zahara's (who Jolie had adopted) last names were changed to Jolie-Pitt, and Pitt's legal adoptions of the children were finalized soon thereafter. But they didn’t get married yet because Brad said he wouldn’t until "everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able." A year later, they were expecting twins! Then finally, ten years after meeting, wedding bells rang. Too bad it only lasted two years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Angelina is stuck with six kids and doesn’t seem to be enjoying parenting alone. Despite this, she has very odd rules that all of her kids must abide by considering they are all under 18. While there are many, here are fifteen of the craziest rules that Jolie has made for her children!</p><h2 id=she-makes-her-kids-eat-bugs>She Makes Her Kids Eat Bugs</h2><p>In a video shared by BBC, Angelina Jolie is seen eating spiders, scorpions and more, encouraging her kids to eat them too. Of course, since she is their mother, they do so. She teaches them how to prepare and cook them and seems to enjoy doing so.</p><p><strong>“See the hard part where you have the teeth? Take the fangs out,” she said, as seen in the video. “I think it’s always been a part of the diet, the bugs, but then I think there is a truth to the survival during the war, of course. When people were being starved, they were able to survive on things like this, and they did.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked how to get started eating such things, she says, “You start with the crickets. Crickets and a beer, and then you kind of move up to the tarantulas.” No thank you, we all say in unison, leave it for your kids.</p><h2 id=she-has-an-unconventional-view-of-education>She Has An Unconventional View Of Education</h2><p>As most people know, Jolie’s parenting style is rather loose. She has homeschooled them for nearly their entire life and refuses to give them normal subjects. They don’t go to school but rather are told to learn whatever they want to learn.</p><p><strong>“Instead of tomfoolery in the classroom, I'd rather them go to a museum and learn to play guitar and read and pick a book they love,” she says.</strong></p><p>Meaning, she takes them on “field trips” and adds extracurricular activities to their schedule rather than the classic big five.</p><p>"I do think we live in a different age and the education system hasn't caught up with our children and our way of life," she continues. The fear that is instilled in so many that kids aren’t being taught core subjects is real. While some parents will try to give their kids more than they’d get out of public school, it seems Angelina Jolie is trying to give them something different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-forces-them-to-learn-a-foreign-language>She Forces Them To Learn&nbsp;A Foreign Language</h2><p>While Jolie can be lenient when it comes to schooling, she has one rule that they all must abide by. As that is the only requirement in her schooling, the kids have to pick a foreign language to learn and have all done so. This isn’t surprising considering so many of them are adopted.</p><p><strong>“All the kids are learning different languages,” Jolie said in 2016. “I asked them what languages they wanted to learn and Shi is learning Khmai, which is the Cambodian language, Pax is focusing on Vietnamese, Mad has taken to German and Russian, Z is speaking French, Vivienne really wanted to learn Arabic, and Knox is learning sign language.”</strong></p><p>That’s a great way to beat the system, Knox! All kidding aside, learning a new language is a great way to learn about other cultures, but the fact that it’s practically the only thing they “have” to learn is what is disconcerting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-lets-them-live-in-a-pig-s-sty>She Lets Them Live In&nbsp;A Pig’s Sty</h2><p>A source calls her house, “a cross between a trashed frat house and a DayGlo-covered rave club.” The thing is, everyone says it wasn’t that way when Brad was there, but now that he has moved out, the kids are allowed to trash the place. Brad had stricter rules and had them clean up their own rooms, but not Angelina. The reason for this is that Angelina wants to be the cool parent, leaving Brad to be the “bad guy.” But whenever the bad guy leaves, you can only imagine what chaos ensues in the household.</p><p>Brad said it himself, “I feel like my job is to show 'em around, help them find what they want to do with their life, put as many things in front of them, and pull them back when they get out of line, so they know who they are." Then what is Angelina’s job?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-sell-baby-pictures-for-millions-of-dollars>They Sell Baby Pictures For Millions Of Dollars</h2><p>Whenever Jolie’s kids are born, there is an expectation of baby pictures. But only if someone is willing to buy them for millions of dollars. For example, “The first pictures of Shiloh were allegedly sold for $4 million to American magazine, People, and for $3.5 million to the UK's magazine, Hello! The picture fees were donated to an undisclosed charity of Brad and Angelina's choice.”</p><p>This happens with every kid as the parents are always looking for a way to donate to charity, even at the expense of exploiting their own children. People think they hide their children to protect them but in actuality, it’s so the photos will be worth more.</p><p><strong>They don’t show their babies until the first photos have already sold and the money has been donated.</strong></p><p>The donations got so large that for the twins, they created their own charity for the occasion called the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-will-make-sure-the-kids-can-t-ever-drink-in-the-house-even-when-they-re-over-21>She Will Make Sure The Kids Can't Ever Drink In The House (Even When They're Over 21)</h2><p>When Jolie filed for divorce, Brad admitted that it was due to his addiction to alcohol. He couldn’t recall a time since college that he hadn’t been abusing a substance. “I was&nbsp;[partying] too much. It’s just become a problem,” Brad Pitt said. “I can’t remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn’t [drinking], or something. I mean, we have a winery. I enjoy wine very, very much, but I just ran it to the ground. I had to step away for a minute. Truthfully, I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good.”</p><p>Although he has supposedly quit and all the children are underage, Jolie has banned alcohol from the home and is not willing to let her children drink even when they get old enough. Talk about freedom.</p><h2 id=nicknames-are-required-for-all-children>Nicknames Are Required For All Children</h2><p>While their names may already be strange to our ears, it’s about to get stranger. All of the kids go by odd nicknames at home and practically only answer to said names. Maddox is known as Mad, Zahara is known as Z, and Shiloh is known as Shi (or possibly John). The younger kids’ names aren’t quite as clear, but we know that Vivienne isn’t called Vivienne. Perhaps time will tell, but many argue that there’s no point in naming your children one thing and calling them something else religiously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, giving them a strange name is illegal in many countries, such as France. For example, when a couple tried to name their baby Nutella, it was changed to Ella as the name Nutella “is contrary to the child’s interest to be wearing a name like that can only lead to teasing or disparaging thoughts.” And we thought Nutella was great!</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-let-them-play-with-kids-their-age-too-often>She Doesn't Let Them Play With Kids Their Age Too Often</h2><p>It’s true, being friends with your family is great, but keeping your kids from the world can really give them a complex. It’s unhealthy to never be around others your age, even as a parent.</p><p>Angelina believes that “family should be your friends” and doesn’t allow the kids to play with others their age often. She claims that, “They’re the best friends I’ve ever had,” when referring to her kids, and it doesn’t look like&nbsp;the kids have any other friends. After all, they are rich, famous, and homeschooled. That all leaves the options pretty limited.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She admits that since the divorce began, she has had them on lockdown and doesn’t let them get out. “I think they’re itching to get out in the world again,” she admitted.</strong></p><p>“We’ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.”</p><h2 id=she-wants-to-be-the-main-parent-in-their-life-and-not-brad>She Wants To Be The Main Parent In Their Life, And Not Brad</h2><p>There is this strong rumor going around that Angelina Jolie wants to take Brad down in order to make herself look better. “Angie says she is going to destroy him,” claims one Jolie friend. “If something is broken, she just throws it away.” Just how bad she wants to destroy her husband isn’t clear, but nearly everyone seems to believe that she does want to.</p><p><strong>Nannies say that she is turning them against their father and refuses to speak of him in a positive light. She won’t allow them to choose him in any case. She wants to be their only role model.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But has anyone looked&nbsp;at why she would think about doing this? The reason for this is likely insecurity. She’s afraid that if they have someone else, then they won’t need her. This is quite common in parents.</p><h2 id=the-nannies-have-no-actual-control-over-the-kids>The Nannies Have No Actual Control Over The Kids</h2><p>The nannies don’t get much room to say what they think while working with her kids. That’s why they speak to the public after they get fired. "The kids delight in letting loose their collection of animals — a number of dogs, cats, hamsters, snakes," one insider states. “And no visitor is safe — not even one employed by mom!”</p><p><strong>“The kids have been openly defiant and unmanageable when it comes to tutors and nannies," a friend of Brad says. "The nannies have no control when it comes to the kids. They pretty much run them."</strong></p><p>No one wants to babysit kids who won’t listen to them and are out of control. But when parents constantly side with the kids, then that’s when the nannies leave for good and don’t look back. If there’s one thing that authority figures need, it’s authority.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=parents-can-t-ever-cry-in-front-of-their-kids>Parents&nbsp;Can't Ever Cry In Front Of Their Kids</h2><p>Is it okay to cry in front of your children? According to Angelina Jolie, the answer is no.</p><p><strong>"I was very worried about my mother, growing up — a lot,” she says. “I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it's very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything's going to be all right even when you're not sure it is."</strong></p><p>Angelina doesn’t believe in letting her emotions show in front of the kids, especially where Brad is concerned. Experts say that this can mess with their own emotional health and insinuates that honesty isn’t necessary, encouraging kids to hold back and bottle up their own emotions. “We’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing,” she says. “They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some… from life, from things in life.” But how can you heal if you never let go?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-wants-everyone-to-pretend-their-lives-are-normal>She Wants Everyone To Pretend Their Lives Are Normal</h2><p>"I'm just wanting to make the proper breakfast and keep the house. That's my passion. At the request of my kids, I'm taking cooking classes," Jolie said. "I've been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I'm getting better at all three.” Her kids have argued with her publicly about her insistence on them being normal. When she confronted her son Knox about the fact he said, "'Who wants to be normal? We're not normal. Let's never be normal.'"</p><p>Knox believes that letting your emotions show is healthy, and they shouldn’t try to hide who they are. After all, Shiloh&nbsp;– who was born a girl – has asked her parents to be identified as male, and wants to be called John. That is not necessarily "typical," but that doesn’t mean it’s not okay. Jolie needs to take a hint from her kids and realize that being normal is overrated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-forces-them-to-be-involved-in-her-humanitarian-activities>She Forces Them To Be Involved In Her Humanitarian Activities</h2><p>For decades, Angelina Jolie has been one of the&nbsp;top humanitarians on Earth. It seems she’s rarely spent time in the States as her goodwill ambassador instincts for the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees has kicked in. That’s all good and fine, but is it okay to force your kids to follow in your footsteps? As expected, they must always abide by Jolie’s humanitarian ways. In December of 2017, Angelina Jolie brought along four of her children to accompany her to the 2017 United Nations Correspondents Association Awards at Cipriani Wall Street, where Jolie was honored as the 2017 UNCA Global Citizen of the year. This is normal, but when the trips become frequent, you realize that the kids may not have a choice.</p><p><strong>“They [children] are not led by strategy, they are led by morality,” she says. “So most of all, thank you to my children. I am so proud of who you are growing up to be and for the hope that gives me for the future.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=each-child-must-spend-alone-time-with-her>Each Child Must Spend Alone Time With Her</h2><p>While Angelina Jolie spends time with all of her kids frequently, she also insists that they have mommy time as well.</p><p><strong>During this, they are forced to spend alone time with her regularly without any of the other kids around. She claims that she will do it on a regular basis with each child.</strong></p><p>She says that it's important that she has this mommy time to bond. And as expected, it's for her, not the kids. For example, she brought her son Pax as her plus-one to the Golden Globes. Then just last spring, she was spotted with him, and him alone, during mommy time at the Pacific Coast Highway eatery. The month before, she took Shiloh to pick out any instrument she wanted. It isn't known if she spends more time with certain kids but she would say that she tries to spend time with each of them equally.</p><h2 id=she-lets-them-run-free-and-wild>She Lets Them Run Free And Wild</h2><p>In general, Jolie’s kids are allowed to run free while out, and this gets on everyone’s nerves&nbsp;–&nbsp;including their father!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>This is one of the things Pitt and Jolie fought about the most. She believed in freedom while he was stricter. "It's not uncommon for all of the kids to be up past midnight during the week, eating sugary snacks and soda,” a source says.</strong></p><p>She’s like that cool aunt that likes the kids to come over but gets tired of them after an hour because they are messy and disrespectful, but at the same time smothers them with attention when it’s not needed. "Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it all together," Angelina said in a recent interview, "but really I am just trying to get through my days... I'm not as strong inside as I have been in the past. I don't enjoy being single.
