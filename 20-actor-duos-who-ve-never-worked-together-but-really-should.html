It seems&nbsp;wild it took so long given the two are such massive stars and friends off-screen. It’s a reminder of how there are scores of actors out there who somehow have never worked together despite how alike they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some are based on how much they look alike, while others off their similar star powers and careers. It helps when some of the duos are friends off-screen, yet it’s also interesting if they have issues with each other. Here are 20 duos who should finally make a movie together, and the pairing alone would make a terrific film.</span></p><h2 id=anne-hathaway-and-natalie-portman-would-be-a-sensational-pairing><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Anne Hathaway And Natalie Portman&nbsp;Would Be A Sensational Pairing</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Two young actresses who became Hollywood A-listers, Natalie Portman and Anne Hathaway, have balanced Oscar-winning turns with major blockbusters. Somehow, their paths have never crossed on screen, which is surprising given their backgrounds.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two are both busy, but would make a terrific on-screen pairing in any sort of film.</span></p><h2 id=jim-carrey-and-adam-sandler-could-combine-comedy-power><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Carrey And Adam Sandler&nbsp;Could Combine Comedy Power</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Through the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey were the kings of comedy. They even share a background in sketch comedy&nbsp;TV, yet have never been in the same film.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>It’d be interesting if they both tried their hands at a drama, but it would&nbsp;be much more fun seeing them in a comedy. Watching these two try to out-mug each other would make for a comedy dream team.</span></p><h2 id=viola-davis-and-regina-king-would-deliver-a-stunning-dramatic-showdown><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Viola Davis And Regina King&nbsp;Would Deliver A Stunning Dramatic Showdown</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>For years, Regina King and Viola Davis were dependable actresses for numerous TV shows and small films. Recently, they’ve each hit the top as Oscar and Emmy winners of hit TV shows.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Seeing these two powerhouse actresses facing off on film would be stunning. They can both bring serious acting chops and make any drama an award-winning piece by joining together.</span></p><h2 id=brad-pitt-and-bradley-cooper-could-use-their-real-friendship-on-screen><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Brad Pitt And Bradley Cooper&nbsp;Could Use Their Real Friendship On-Screen</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In several interviews, Brad Pitt has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">credited</a> Bradley Cooper with helping him through some personal issues. Maybe it’s time that paid off on screen.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In many ways, Cooper is like Pitt, a handsome actor who’s moved into serious dramas, and they would be great on-screen together. If nothing else, it’d be nice for Pitt to pay back Cooper’s help by giving him an excellent on-screen push.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=any-combination-of-jennifer-lawrence-brie-larson-and-emma-stone-would-be-fantastic><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Any Combination Of Jennifer Lawrence, Brie Larson, And Emma Stone Would Be Fantastic</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Okay, this may be a cheat as it’s a trio, not a duo. However, given how they’re all good <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">friends</a>, the fact that Jennifer Lawrence, Brie Larson, and Emma Stone have never found a way to work together seems impossible.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The three Oscar winners have long supported each other, and any combination of them on screen would be great. If somehow, all three of them were to share a movie, it would be one of the best star power projects imaginable.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Feuds Between Co-Stars That Went Way Too Far</a></span></p><h2 id=it-s-time-cruise-and-hanks-brought-the-two-toms-together><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>It’s Time Cruise And Hanks Brought The Two Toms Together</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s another case of two actors who have never worked together over such long careers. Tom Cruise seems to not age as he continues to put out thrilling action roles. Tom Hanks&nbsp;is hailed as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They may have different styles, but a movie uniting Hollywood’s two most famous Toms is something long overdue for a fun ride.&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gosling-and-reynolds-would-be-fantastic-as-the-double-ryans><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Gosling and Reynolds&nbsp;Would Be Fantastic As The Double Ryans</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>These two Canadian stars often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joke</a> about being mixed up at times. Ryan Gosling has gone from just a handsome face to a respected actor with a few Oscar nominations. Ryan Reynolds has become a hit as Deadpool and known for his funny style.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two would have a blast on screen, especially in a comedy where they can trade insults. It would be sure to attract female viewers ready to fight on who’s the hotter Ryan.</span></p><h2 id=christian-bale-and-ben-affleck-could-give-us-a-battle-of-the-batmen><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Christian Bale And Ben Affleck Could Give Us A Battle Of The Batmen</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>The connection between these two is undeniable. Just imagine seeing the most recent big-screen Batmen going one-on-one. Christian Bale did work with Ben’s brother, Casey Affleck, in the thriller Out Of the Furnace but not Ben himself.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It would be fascinating if Affleck were to direct Bale in some drama, but a big-screen face-off would be better for a clash of the Dark Knights.</span></p><h2 id=amy-adams-and-jessica-chastain-could-have-fun-with-being-lookalikes><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Amy Adams And Jessica Chastain&nbsp;Could Have Fun With Being Lookalikes</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Amy Adams and Jessica Chastain have both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked</a>&nbsp;about how easily they get mixed up for each other (and others) at times. Maybe it would be good to settle that by appearing together on screen.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>They’re both very talented actresses who are capable of either high drama or a fun comedy.

Supposedly, Jared Leto, who played the Joker in Suicide Squad, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t happy</a> with Phoenix’s take. So maybe it’s time they settled it on screen.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Okay, a Joker vs Joker battle is unlikely. Yet, seeing two actors as method as Phoenix and Leto together would be a serious movie-going experience as they try to out-act each other.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joker: 11 Things They Got Wrong (& 4 They Got Right)</a></span></p><h2 id=denzel-washington-and-will-smith-need-to-finally-combine-on-screen><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Denzel Washington And Will Smith Need To Finally Combine On Screen</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Denzel Washington has been a steady Hollywood icon for over 30 years. Will Smith is one of the most successful box office stars of his time. But somehow, these two popular actors have never shared the screen together.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>It was to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">happen</a> in 2012, but that fell through.

Matt Bomer has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored</a> to take on the role of Superman when Henry Cavill bows out. It helps that he and Cavill look much alike, and they’ve even mocked their resemblance.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even if it’s not a DC movie, seeing Cavill and Bomer sharing the screen would be fun.</span></p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-and-jake-gyllenhaal-could-be-amazingly-offbeat-together><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Leonardo DiCaprio And Jake Gyllenhaal Could&nbsp;Be Amazingly Offbeat Together</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Leonardo DiCaprio has elevated himself from just a handsome leading man to an Oscar-winning icon of cool style.&nbsp;Jake Gyllenhaal has also gone from hunk to an actor known for his quirky projects. Together, they could be terrific on-screen.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two are friends and can use that chemistry for any project. A drama is good, but it’d be fun seeing them in a comedy to pay off on their friendship.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-evans-and-john-krasinski-need-to-do-more-than-a-commercial><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Chris Evans And John Krasinski Need To Do More Than A Commercial</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Technically, they have worked together in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent</a> Super Bowl commercial. Yet, that wasn’t enough for Chris Evans and John Krasinski. Krasinski was a candidate for Captain America but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> Evans played the role much better than he could have.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With Evans leaving Cap behind and Krasinski proving himself as a writer/director, the time is right for them to do a film together finally. It’s one road trip fans would love to take with them.</span></p><h2 id=elijah-wood-and-daniel-radcliffe-could-bring-their-fake-feud-to-life><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Elijah Wood And Daniel Radcliffe&nbsp;Could Bring Their Fake Feud To Life</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>These two are a lot alike and not just in looks. They’re each famous for a big-screen franchise and both capable actors to boot. Somehow, they’ve never crossed paths on the screen, which seems like a missed opportunity.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The duo has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mocked</a> being in a “feud” and are eager to work together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Co-Star Feuds That Were Totally Fake</a></span></p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-and-matthew-mcconaughey-would-be-the-essence-of-cool><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Keanu Reeves And Matthew McConaughey Would Be The Essence Of Cool</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>We’re in the middle of a “Keanussaince” as Keanu Reeves is riding high from John Wick to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 video game.

Each got famous for an early role but went from “hot blonde” parts to award-worthy performances. The two are notable for how they’re near doppelgangers despite the age difference.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Having them on screen would be a fun way to mock the resemblance but also provide a fun dynamic to use for a movie.</span></p><h2 id=meryl-streep-and-helen-mirren-would-be-an-acting-clash-of-titans><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Meryl Streep And Helen Mirren&nbsp;Would Be An Acting&nbsp;Clash Of Titans</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meryl Streep is the most honored actress in history with 21 Oscar nominations and three wins. Helen Mirren is a Dame and Oscar winner herself who’s a British acting icon. Yet, these two have never made a movie together, which would be terrific.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They’re each amazing actresses who can get wicked if they want to, so having them together on screen would be a terrific acting duel.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-and-charlize-theron-would-sizzle-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><span style=font-weight:400>Angelina Jolie And Charlize Theron Would Sizzle Together</span></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>These two ladies&nbsp;are very much alike in balancing compelling dramas with big-budget action pieces.
