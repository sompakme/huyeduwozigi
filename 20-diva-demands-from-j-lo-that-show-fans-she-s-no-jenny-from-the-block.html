Four words no one wants to hear. Jenny from the block was a down-to-earth, real persona that we could finally relate to, but it's about to get a bit embarrassing. Jennifer Lopez's career spans over 20 years, but the most powerful Latina woman in music is nowhere near done. Her reported $20 million guest fee on American Idol is just adding to her net worth of $360 million, but it turns out Ms. Lopez is quite the madam. "I'm Real?" Hmm...</p><p>Hide all you want behind the designer shades, but when the press get ahold of your two-page diva demands, they're going to share them. J-Lo has been known to ghost her own private jet attendants–&nbsp;&nbsp;while they were offering her beverages&nbsp;–&nbsp;although walking three blocks is just too much for the energetic singer and dancer. From getting innocent hotel staff fired on the spot, to total "meltdowns" if her M&Ms aren't&nbsp;exactly as she wants them, J-Lo&nbsp;is one of the most high-maintenance divas the world has ever seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You only need to look at this list to realize why the "three divorces" status makes sense.&nbsp;Jennifer may post photos of her intense workouts on her Instagram, but her real life is all about making other people sweat. While J-Lo's music will always be legendary, this is making Jen legendary for the wrong reasons. It's even been reported that she'll only consider marrying A-Rod if he's "prepared to commit" to specific requirements. We've saved you the research by putting together a nice list.&nbsp;"Love Don't Cost A Thing?" Here are 20 diva demands from J-Lo that prove she's no "Jenny From The Block."</p><h2 id=lime-blossom-or-grapefruit-scented-candles-only><strong>LIME BLOSSOM OR GRAPEFRUIT-SCENTED CANDLES ONLY</strong></h2><p>Here's something interesting. If you Google "Jennifer Lopez candles," you get a bunch of results for the singer's own range of candles. But they're not available to buy. Why? Well, when you're a diva whose hotel room demands include lime blossom or Jo Malone grapefruit-scented candles, no one actually wants to buy the ones you were selling. The Mirror reported that J-Lo's arrival in a hotel basically paralyzes the entire staff with fear. To be fair, that's become commonplace for five-star hotels awaiting celeb royalty. Beyonce wouldn't book her hotel suite without ensuring Blue Ivy's $20,000 hand-made crib (complete with rose-petal candles) was flown in. Christina Aguilera asks police escorts to do the impossible – fight traffic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>J-Lo's hotel arrivals are literally panic-inducing for staff. The American Idol judge reportedly "loses her mind" if her suite isn't awaiting her with lime blossom or grapefruit-scented Jo Malone candles. Just one of those retails for around $500.</strong></p><p>Seriously, just listen to this woman's lyrics. "So you're tryna buy what's already yours...What I need from you is not available in stores." Right, your own candles. Because everyone is so fed up with your diva demands, they don't want to be associated with you. We'll never hate on J-Lo for her epic music, but with 19 more of these demands, we're looking at the star in a different light...</p><h2 id=she-will-have-a-meltdown-if-sunflower-seeds-lack-shells><strong>SHE WILL HAVE A MELTDOWN IF SUNFLOWER SEEDS LACK SHELLS</strong></h2><p>You know when you're sitting there with a bowl of peanuts and some binge-worthy TV? You sit there and crack them open yourself. If you're eating pistachios, you'll work your way through the "easy" ones where the shell opens easily. You give up on the ones that just won't crack. Jennifer is a star who literally cracks if her hotel suite snacks aren't 100% perfect. The Daily Mail got ahold of the TWO-PAGE food and beverage demands&nbsp;J-Lo sent in advance to the five-star The Dorchester hotel in London. A one-night stay in their top suite? That'll cost you $50,000. Sure, superstars are all about the healthy nutrition. For J-Lo, it's definitely healthy, but it is not laid-back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside specifically prepared fresh fruit platters, soft-baked chocolate chip cookies, and chips that MUST be sour cream and onion flavor, Jennifer requires Planter's sunflower seeds. Good luck if you dish them up without the shells. "My diva reputation is undeserved," she told The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>This woman doesn't mince her words, or her collaborations. Teaming up with Pitbull for a song might make for great music, but who's the pit bull here? Hey, at least she's doing hotel staff a favor with the lyrics, there. "Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza. Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa." So, basically, a list of all the places that should start pouring sunflower seeds into bowls –&nbsp;with the shells...?</p><h2 id=she-needs-seven-limousines-to-travel-three-blocks><strong>SHE NEEDS SEVEN LIMOUSINES TO TRAVEL THREE BLOCKS</strong></h2><p>Celebs seem to undergo some weird biological mutation as soon as they get super rich, super powerful, and super famous. Ariana Grande infamously gets "carried around like a baby" when her feet are "too tired to touch the floor." While Christina will let hers make contact with the ground, she has someone to massage her feet every 30 minutes, according to Hello. For someone as energetic as J-Lo – have you seen&nbsp;those Instagram workouts, you'd think "Jenny from the Block" would be okay to walk a few blocks. How naive of us to think that might be the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When J-Lo stayed in London, she made seven limousines escort her for the three block&nbsp;journey to lunch at The Dorchester Hotel. "I am 100% convinced that working out is part of what makes me so happy," the singer said.</strong></p><p>In a long interview (presumably with non-peeled sunflower seeds), J-Lo spoke to Hello about her intense workout regimen. The singer said that she works out seven days a week. "I love the way working out makes me feel," Jen said. "I try to keep my body well rested after every workout." So rested that you can't walk the three blocks to lunch?</p><h2 id=staff-must-wear-all-white-outfits><strong>STAFF MUST WEAR ALL WHITE OUTFITS</strong></h2><p>For some reason, celebs associate the color white with success. Rappers are cruising up and down Rodeo Drive in white Ferraris. Kanye West is filming his latest rants in an all-white wardrobe. Guess what? Jennifer Lopez is no different. Well, aside from being more extreme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does&nbsp;she require all-white dressing rooms (and those candles have to be white), she's also been reported to force her entire entourage to wear the color, head-to-toe. During her 2007, The Mirror reported that J-Lo sent out a memo to her entire staff: wear white. Think that's just for the tours?&nbsp;She actually gave birth to her twins in an all-white fur coat. "I think of the day my kids were born," she said. "I wore this big white fur coat."</p><p>"I got a moniker of being a diva," Jen told The Huffington Post. "I feel I never deserved it because I've always been a hard worker, on time, doing what I'm supposed to do." Celeb behavior behind closed doors has become big news, especially with Kim Kardashian's ex-assistant, Stephanie Shepherd spilling the beans. Kim K doesn't seem to be fussed on color. Still, when The Daily Star reported Stephanie as calling Kim "a slob who takes 6000 selfies over four days," the world was shocked. If you're a J-Lo fan and want a chance, wear white.</p><h2 id=she-needs-gatorade-at-room-and-refrigerated-temperatures><strong>SHE NEEDS GATORADE AT ROOM AND REFRIGERATED TEMPERATURES</strong></h2><p>Celebrity beverage demands – where&nbsp;do we even start? Between Taylor Swift's pre-11 a.m. double Starbucks orders and Beyonce's $900 titanium straws, there doesn't seem to be a celeb out there who doesn't have this as their order: Ridiculous.&nbsp;J-Lo just about manages to pull off "chilled" on her Instagram. She'll cozy up to Leah Remini in bathrobes – all-white, of course. She'll allow Jennifer Aniston to photobomb her at awards. We've even had some #nomakeup shots.&nbsp;Her all-time favorite activity, though? Hydrating. Trust us. That interview she gave to Hello about her fitness? Half the page was her rambling on about how "important" hydration is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>J-Lo is big fan of sports hydration drinks like Gatorade. What she's less a fan of, though, is not having them served to her at the precise temperature she dictates. According to The Mirror,&nbsp;Jennifer's hotel room bar requirements include a strict setup of regular Coke, Diet Coke, caffeine-free coke, lemon wedges, honey, and Gatorade. Her Smart water and fruit punch or orange Gatorade&nbsp;must be available at both room and refrigerated temperatures.</p><p>And you wonder why this diva has three divorces behind her. The Daily Mail has even reported that J-Lo will only consider marriage to A-Rod if he complies with all of her demands. "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block." Seriously?</p><h2 id=she-got-hotel-staff-fired-for-autograph-requests><strong>SHE&nbsp;GOT HOTEL STAFF FIRED FOR AUTOGRAPH REQUESTS</strong></h2><p>This one is just all kinds of ironic. J-Lo has a fair few movie roles under her belt. In this pic? She's playing a hotel room cleaner in the movie, Maid In Manhattan. Much like Jennifer's own Hispanic roots, the character plays a Puerto Rican hotel maid trying to make ends meet. It was more scandal than accolades for Jen in 2012, though.&nbsp;Her travels to Germany made major headlines as a hotel worker, Pray Dodaj, was reportedly fired on the spot for requesting an autograph. According to The Daily Mail, Pray asked&nbsp;her assistant for an autograph and was fired the next day for no reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"A day later, the cleaning company that employed me at the hotel called and said Ms. Lopez had complained. I was fired right there on the phone." That's from the hotel worker who politely asked for an autograph.</strong></p><p>The hotel denied the rumors, as did J-Lo, who called the story "hurtful." Of course, when Jennifer was being interviewed by BBC on playing a hotel worker in Maid In Manhattan, she only had wholesome things to say. "My character is just trying to make ends meet. I really relate to her. You shouldn't judge or discard people." Talk about putting your money where your mouth is...</p><h2 id=she-won-t-actually-go-to-the-bronx><strong>SHE WON'T ACTUALLY GO TO THE BRONX</strong></h2><p>Pulling yourself out of poverty is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it can be something to be proud of. A homeless Chris Pratt was serving up shrimp and living out of an RV before he got famous. Mila Kunis' family moved to the US with just $250 to their name. While some celebs put their humble roots behind them and never look back, a huge chunk of J-Lo's fame comes from repeating over and over: "I'm Still Jenny From The Block."&nbsp;She grew up in The Bronx, and her family wasn't rich. "I shared a bed with my two sisters," Jen told E! News about her poor upbringing. And yet, she won't actually go back there...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Despite growing up in poverty in the Bronx (and writing a song about it), J-Lo only agreed to be in a vehicle commercial if she "didn't actually have to go to the Bronx."</strong></p><p>The report centered around J-Lo's 2011 Fiat commercial, where the company figured it would be neat to film the star in her home territory. While the ad appears to be in the Bronx, it was actually filmed in Los Angeles. E! reported that J-Lo used a body double for the Bronx. We literally have no words....</p><h2 id=she-needs-plain-m-amp-ms-or-she-loses-it><strong>SHE NEEDS PLAIN M&MS OR SHE&nbsp;LOSES IT</strong></h2><p>A celebrity dressing room is nothing without the tray of nibbles. That's cool, no biggie. Britney Spears likes Poptarts and tuna mayo sandwiches in hers. Kendall Jenner munches on carrot sticks, hummus, and Twix bars. Each star has their preferences, but the problem isn't what they're asking for. It's the way they behave when they don't get what they requested. Ever been to a restaurant and accidentally received a "not-quite-what-I-ordered" dish? It happens. Most of us keep it chilled – we accept that we only got regular instead of curly fries. The most we might do is send a steak back&nbsp;– politely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>J-Lo's long list of dressing room demands includes a very specific PLAIN ONLY M&Ms. Sources told TMZ that the star "freaks out" if the wrong kind is left out. This just turns hilarious when you remember the whole Matthew McConaughey and J-Lo "M&Ms thing." In the movie, The Wedding Planner, Matthew McConaughey tells&nbsp;Jennifer that "brown M&Ms are healthier than the other colors."</p><p>J-Lo takes her nutrition pretty seriously. While it's nice to see celebs indulging just like the rest of us, it's a little less sweet to see the dictatorial way they demand their food. Would peanut M&Ms be such a disaster? Apparently so.</p><h2 id=she-needs-oscillating-fans-in-her-80-degree-rooms><strong>SHE NEEDS OSCILLATING FANS IN HER 80 DEGREE ROOMS</strong></h2><p>Are you wearing long sleeves because your room temperature isn't just right? Most of us, you know, adapt to the environment we're in. If we're lucky to be somewhere with AC, great. If not, we deal. J-Lo reportedly requires two oscillating fans in her hotel rooms, which must be cooled to a precise 80 degrees. Something about oscillating fans just says "diva." Maybe it's because Mariah Carey also insists on them – alongside the $100,000 she spends a month having exotic flowers flown out to her. For a woman who posts sweat-dripping Instagram shots of workouts with Dwayne Johnson, we're looking at some serious double standards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>J-Los rooms must have two oscillating fans and be cooled to a precise 80 degrees. Coming from the woman who posts sweat-drenched gym selfies with Dwayne Johnson, we're not impressed.</strong></p><p>Hotel workers have known to prepare themselves for all sorts when&nbsp;she's in town – for quite a while now. 2002 was the year J-Lo was in London for her movie, Maid In Manhattan. She stayed at The Metropolitan Hotel, where staff were said to be "baffled" by her extravagant demands, according to The Sun. And that was just the "thousands of dollars worth" of scented candles.</p><h2 id=no-flight-communication-in-her-private-jet><strong>NO FLIGHT COMMUNICATION (IN HER PRIVATE JET)</strong></h2><p>Well, of course she's going to talk to him. J-Lo is every inch the glam superstar on her private jet here with her&nbsp;boyfriend, A-Rod. Traveling by private jet is hardly news in celeb land. You're not a Kardashian unless you fly by private jet, and everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kate Middleton has been spotted traveling luxuriously. Well, Kate is actually a rarity. The royal family actually have to support British Airways, so even the wife to Britain's future king flies commercial. J-Lo came under fire when reports emerged that she was ghosting her own in-flight attendants – as they were trying to serve her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>A flight attendant offered J-Lo a drink in her private jet, and she reportedly refused to acknowledge him "Please tell him I'd like a Diet Coke and lime," she said to her assistant.</strong></p><p>The Daily Mail ran this story alongside a string of other in-flight rules that J-Lo reportedly makes her staff follow.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you're being employed by the great Jennifer Lopez, get her stuff the way she wants it, but don't talk to her. Before flying all around the world in style,&nbsp;she actually landed a gig as a Fly Girl dancer back in 1991 on the comedy series, In Living Color. While it's more Shades of Blue now, there's still nothing funny about this.</p><h2 id=she-requires-suite-delivered-breakfasts><strong>SHE REQUIRES SUITE-DELIVERED&nbsp;BREAKFASTS</strong></h2><p>Who doesn't love breakfast in bed? Honestly, that isn't something many of us get. If you're a girl, he might just remember for your anniversary. If you're a guy – seriously, that is some seriously hard multi-tasking when it comes to it. The 2007 hotel list that showed J-Lo demands was, according to Hello, a TWO-PAGE document. Of course, it included Jen's&nbsp;breakfast requirements. Anytime Jen books a hotel room and happens to arrive early, she expects breakfast to be waiting for her&nbsp;– hot&nbsp;– no matter what time she arrives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>J-Lo breakfast-in-bed requirements include&nbsp;scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, white toast, and potatoes. Regardless of when she arrives, the food must be hot. Regular and decaf coffee must also be provided.&nbsp;The Sun continued to list the silverware requirements that form&nbsp;her&nbsp;endless requirements.</p><p>Jen's diva demands also seem to have gotten more extreme as she's gotten more famous. J-Lo is earning a reported $20 million per cycle on American Idol. While it's great to see aspiring singers get advice from the greatest there is, it's kind of disgraceful. Sitting there in a chair judging people and getting paid more than we could dream of earning in a lifetime? Still, good choice of breakfast. That we can't slam...</p><h2 id=no-eye-contact><strong>NO EYE CONTACT</strong></h2><p>This is the kind of stuff you hear about in religious texts. You know, maybe a sacred site that people visit but aren't allowed to actually look at? J-Lo seems to have developed quite the ego, according to Hello. In 2012, reports surfaced that a "no eye contact" rule had left construction workers pretty dismayed as they worked to refurbish her luxury home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While having work done on the San Fernando Valley property, it was reported that none of the helpers, drivers, or contractors were permitted to talk to J-Lo, let alone make eye contact with her. As construction workers sweltered in the San Fernando Valley heat refurbishing J-Lo mansion, they weren't allowed to speak to her or make eye contact. Just work, work, work.</p><p>Property portfolios are quite the thing in Hollywood. Hidden Hills mansions get bought and sold for million dollar profits like there's no tomorrow, and J-Lo is no different. In 2017,&nbsp;she listed her Manhattan Penthouse for $27 million. The same year, she purchased a $40 million Bel Air mansion complete with a three-sided infinity pool, dual dressing rooms, a private beach, and an&nbsp;outdoor amphitheater. The place is dripping in marbles, mahoganies, and dim lighting. Presumably, because Ms. Lopez "doesn't want to be disturbed."</p><h2 id=her-own-music-must-be-playing><strong>HER OWN MUSIC MUST BE PLAYING</strong></h2><p>Okay, we get it. You dig your own music. J-Lo has earned her place as a music superstar with some of the catchiest tracks ever released. She's collaborated with Lil Wayne, Ja Rule, Nas, and Iggy Azalea. Music is a huge part of her life, and&nbsp;she has personally said that she "lives for it." Back in 2007, before iPhones and tablets, J-Lo was reported by The Daily Mail as insisting that her hotel room VCR and CD players be playing her own music.&nbsp;&nbsp;The request was said to be "mandatory," alongside specific rap and hip-hop requests from Lauryn Hill and Mary J. Blige.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Maybe, sitting there in her $50,000 suite with the plain M&Ms, refrigerated Gatorade, and $500 candles, Jen needed a reminder of the lyrics, "I'm still Jenny from the block."</strong></p><p>Make no mistake, though. J-Lo riches from the music industry haven't come without their fair share of scandal.&nbsp;Jennifer has actually been accused of stealing material from other artists, according to TMZ. The singer, Chante Moore claimed that "Diddy" Sean Combs gave a track she was working on to J-Lo. The track in question? "If You Had My Love," which&nbsp;she earned millions from. Guess it's her block, then...</p><h2 id=she-likes-her-custom-boats-but-keep-the-noise-down><strong>SHE LIKES HER CUSTOM BOATS (BUT KEEP THE NOISE DOWN)</strong></h2><p>When you're inching your way to half a billion dollars, you customize everything. Those $2.5 million pacifiers Jay-Z and Beyonce bought their twins? Hello didn't mention the couple "buying off the shelf." If there's anywhere celebs love to hang, it's on the water. Leonardo DiCaprio watches the soccer World Cup by renting out a $600 million yacht. Kendall Jenner and her supermodel squads are always on some kind of boat. J-Lo takes water sports requirements to a whole other level, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When The Mirror covered Jen's diva demands for the World Music Awards, they reported that she requested to be ferried from Cannes to Monaco by a&nbsp;custom-made speedboat. The vessel reportedly came complete with J-Lo customized love seats, faux leather, and champagne coolers. But keep the noise down! A pair of $5800 diamond-encrusted headphones were also demanded to "drown out the noise."</p><p>Jen reportedly spent the night celebrating on the owner of Topshop, Sir Philip Green's yacht before being transferred by speedboat to Monaco for the WMA. Monaco is the richest corner of Europe. Really. The place may as well be invite-only. While J-Lo told The Mirror,&nbsp;"Hey ladies! I'll be seeing you later! Get ready to party," she's clearly a fan of noise – only when she wants it.</p><h2 id=she-wants-her-mirrors-positioned-at-certain-angles><strong>SHE WANTS HER MIRRORS POSITIONED AT CERTAIN ANGLES&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here's something that seems to go hand-in-hand: celebrities and vanity. Kim K got a nice reality check recently, as her assistant revealed that "Kim has people move objects or plants if they're in the way of a mirror." If they aren't using them for lucrative selfies, celebs are spending inordinate amounts of time admiring themselves in front of the mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're J-Lo, though, those mirrors have to be laid out in a very specific way. When J-Lo travels, she travels in style. That means one hotel room for herself, and one for her metric ton of luggage. Forget the main room mirrors. Her&nbsp;dressing rooms need mirrors.&nbsp;Part of&nbsp;her agreement to sing at the World Music Awards in 2010 involved a strict dressing room setup. Hanging mirrors for her makeup had to be at specific angles.</p><p>This is the kind of stuff that makes Mariah Carey look like a saint. An on-call masseuse also had to be available round-the-clock. The Mirror&nbsp;also reported that J-Lo wanted her helicopter "on standby."&nbsp;She has given interviews recently on how she feels about herself as she approaches 50. "Women get more confident as they get older," she told W Magazine. Presumably, only if the mirrors are just right, though...</p><h2 id=she-requires-exotic-fruit-platters-with-seedless-grapes><strong>SHE REQUIRES EXOTIC FRUIT PLATTERS WITH SEEDLESS GRAPES</strong></h2><p>No one's slamming stars for eating right. Hollywood is so messed-up about body image and dieting, it's refreshing to see a woman like J-Lo own her curves while still being total #fitspo. The singer lives an energetic lifestyle packed with workouts, dance routines, and plenty of healthy food. Part of that diet includes a lot of fruit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's less refreshing is the diva way that fruit platter is ordered. It's when stars start to get really specific that the simplicity of fruit turns borderline creepy. J-Lo fruit platter must be ready and waiting for her, according to Hello. The contents?&nbsp;Her fruit platters must have watermelon, green seedless grapes, pineapple, and mango. The veggie platter must be SEPARATE, with carrots, broccoli, and ranch dressing.</p><p>Add on the soft-baked cookies, temperature-controlled beverages, sour cream and onion chips only... J-Lo isn't sending out impressive lists. She's finding herself on ones like these. Joining her in the ridiculous food demands, according to Business Insider are Katy Perry (tortilla chips must be blue corn), Kanye West (Sunkist Salted Pistachio nuts&nbsp;– no red coloring), and Beyonce (chicken wings, legs, and breast only with fresh garlic and garlic steamed broccoli). Eminem? He just needs 2 loaves of bread and some sodas. This guy deserves an award for just being reasonable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=want-her-to-judge-that-will-cost-20-million><strong>WANT&nbsp;HER TO JUDGE? THAT WILL COST $20 MILLION</strong></h2><p>Celeb salary demands started getting ridiculous a long time ago. Long before Kylie Jenner was getting paid $100,000 to attend her own 18th birthday party, movie stars were right on it. $50 million is what Tom Cruise has earned from just one of the Mission Impossible movies (although he does pull his own stunts). Kristen Stewart walked away from the Twilight series with a $34.5 million paycheck. Emma Watson's Harry Potter total? $60 million. Still, all of those required at least one year of dedicated work. Being a judge on American Idol? It's basically just being flown in for a few hours, then getting a lot of editing work to make you look like "you were there for months."</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez's fee for American Idol is a reported $20 million per cycle. That's a total month's worth of filming, tops. In 2013, that figure was $15 million. Clearly not enough for Ms. Lopez.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>J-Lo has been a core judge on American Idol for over five cycles now. She has personally credited the show for "relaunching her career" with TV drama, Shades of Blue and her Vegas tour. That said, in an interview Jen gave to The Independent about her roots, Jen just rambled on about the Bronx and her "upbringing," which she clearly has long forgotten.</p><h2 id=she-gets-45-foot-luxury-trailers-for-music-videos><strong>SHE GETS 45-FOOT LUXURY TRAILERS FOR MUSIC VIDEOS</strong></h2><p>If J-Lo is filming a music video&nbsp;(maybe about how she grew up dirt poor and "knew what it's like" to live on the breadline) she asks for the height of luxury.&nbsp;The Sun got ahold of the requirements Ms. Lopez had – just to fill the 45-foot trailer she needed to "relax" in while filming a recent music video. The document is literally painful to read, so we'll break it down for you.</p><p>First off, there are the dimensions themselves. J-Lo insisted on a 45-foot trailer with triple slide-outs and two entry doors. Amenities must include a hair and makeup station (for her 12-person hair and makeup entourage),&nbsp;with an all-white dressing room, white tablecloths, white drapes and couches, and no catering in the actual dressing room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The usual fruit and vegetable platter were on there, alongside apple pie, dew melon, vanilla ice-cream, brownies, plus beverages. Her Evian water MUST&nbsp;be room temperature, and be accompanied by Snapple (raspberry, lemon, and iced tea flavors). No tomato, apple, or grape juices are allowed. The list basically goes on to list a ton of flowers, candles, various beverages, and the sizes, widths, heights, and shape of everything inside the trailer. Kind of ironic, considering Shades of Blue portrays Jennifer as a gritty, down-to-earth cop who's totally "from the hood."</p><h2 id=she-will-only-marry-a-rod-if-he-complies-to-her-requests><strong>SHE WILL ONLY MARRY A-ROD IF HE COMPLIES TO HER REQUESTS</strong></h2><p>Hey! You get what you ask for when you date Jennifer Lopez. Following three failed marriages, J-Lo is currently dating professional baseball player Alex Rodriguez. They're one of the most high-profile couples in Hollywood. Given J-Lo's demands, though, they're also one of the most high-maintenance. TMZ has reported that&nbsp;she will only consider marrying A-Rod if he agrees to a list of demands, and they're no "regular" demands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>J-Lo will only consider marrying A-Rod if he doesn't speak to any women under the age of 40. Jennifer also "loves his physique," and wants to guarantee that A-Rod won't let himself go if they get married.</strong></p><p>Neither Jen nor A-Rod have confirmed these rumors, but you've got to admit, they're pretty demanding. Asking your husband not to speak to a single woman under the age of 40 is kind of asking the impossible. What? He can't speak to someone in Target? Who will actually get the flight attendant to bring the drinks, since J-Lo herself won't speak to them? As to maintaining his physique, that's kind of unfair. You're supposed to love someone for who they are – not how they look. J-Lo herself has said "you shouldn't judge people on appearances." Pot calling the kettle black?</p><h2 id=the-nerve-to-say-she-s-not-a-diva><strong>THE NERVE TO SAY SHE'S "NOT A DIVA"</strong></h2><p>Most divas stay nice and quiet if they're ever approached by the press regarding their extortionate demands. When Mariah Carey's billionaire fiancé James Packer reportedly dumped Mariah on account of her extravagant spending, she did burn a $250,000 custom-made Valentino gown in a fire pit – but she didn't give interviews. Media outlets are desperate to interview stars about just this kind of stuff, but they'll find every door firmly shut in their face. The star's rep definitely won't call them back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Jennifer actually has the nerve to give interviews denying the whole "diva" thing. "I've always been fascinated by how much more well-behaved we have to be than&nbsp;men," J-Lo told The Huffington Post. What? Like demanding that A-Rod stay in shape? "I'm not a diva," she said.</strong></p><p>It's unlikely J-Lo would be willing to give a similar interview answering to all 20 items on this list, so we'll assume she's "not available for comment."</p><p>Unfortunately, with this list, you now have proof that one of music's greatest icons is also one of the biggest divas.&nbsp;With 20 ways to prove that she's no "Jenny From The Block," get the word out. Hit share on Facebook – especially if your friends are fans&nbsp;of&nbsp;American Idol. This "I'm Real" singer needs a reality check.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGKxprnAp5usZZanvK55yWajqGWkna61edKhprBllpa7tHnSoZysZZ6kequxzaewZp6ipLpuwMeeZJukn5i4cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-diva-demands-from-j-lo-that-show-fans-she-s-no-jenny-from-the-block.html&text=20%20Diva%20Demands%20From%20J-Lo%20That%20Show%20Fans%20She%27s%20No%20Jenny%20From%20The%20Block&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-diva-demands-from-j-lo-that-show-fans-she-s-no-jenny-from-the-block.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-diva-demands-from-j-lo-that-show-fans-she-s-no-jenny-from-the-block.html&title=20%20Diva%20Demands%20From%20J-Lo%20That%20Show%20Fans%20She%27s%20No%20Jenny%20From%20The%20Block" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-diva-demands-from-j-lo-that-show-fans-she-s-no-jenny-from-the-block.html&title=20%20Diva%20Demands%20From%20J-Lo%20That%20Show%20Fans%20She%27s%20No%20Jenny%20From%20The%20Block" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-diva-demands-from-j-lo-that-show-fans-she-s-no-jenny-from-the-block.html&title=20%20Diva%20Demands%20From%20J-Lo%20That%20Show%20Fans%20She%27s%20No%20Jenny%20From%20The%20Block" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-diva-demands-from-j-lo-that-show-fans-she-s-no-jenny-from-the-block.html&description=20%20Diva%20Demands%20From%20J-Lo%20That%20Show%20Fans%20She%27s%20No%20Jenny%20From%20The%20Block" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ellen-degeneres-roasts-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-s-vogue-cover.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ellen DeGeneres Roasts Justin Bieber, Hailey Baldwins Vogue Cover">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suede-brooks-is-apparently-dating-richie-akiva-amid-rumors-with-drake.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suede Brooks Is Apparently Dating Richie Akiva Amid Rumors With Drake">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
