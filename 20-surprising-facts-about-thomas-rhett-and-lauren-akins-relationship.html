Some of his most recognizable songs are Die A Happy Man, Marry Me, and Unforgettable. Most people don’t know that Thomas’ father was also a country music singer. Thomas actually didn’t want to follow in his father’s footsteps after seeing what stardom did to his family, but he and his wife Lauren somehow make it work.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=s1>Thomas and Lauren are one of Hollywood’s sweetest couples. They are real with their fans, are always positive and uplifting, and have the cutest family you could ask for. But who is the couple behind the scenes? Here are 20 surprising facts about Thomas Rhett and Lauren Akins’ relationship.</span></p><h2 id=thomas-and-lauren-met-in-kindergarten><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><span class=s1>Thomas And Lauren Met In&nbsp;Kindergarten</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>While it’s not common for most celebrities, Thomas Rhett actually met his wife when they were just kids. Thomas and his wife, then known as Lauren Gregory, were in the same Kindergarten class at Goodpasture Christian in Madison, Georgia. They didn’t become friends until they were in sixth grade.</span></p><h2 id=they-were-best-friends-growing-up><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><span class=s1>They Were Best Friends Growing Up</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Thomas and Lauren didn’t become good friends until they were in sixth grade, despite going to school together since kindergarten. They had ups and downs for much of their relationship, throughout middle school and high school, but always remained friends. Thomas said that he really noticed her long before Lauren started paying closer attention to him.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thomas-and-lauren-went-to-church-camp-together><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><span class=s1>Thomas And Lauren Went To Church Camp Together</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Both Thomas and Lauren have been outspoken about their faith and the way they live (and how they are choosing to raise their family). They also talk often about attending church on their social media channels. So it comes as no surprise that they actually attended church camp together when they were 13 years old.</span></p><h2 id=they-briefly-dated-when-they-were-teenagers><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><span class=s1>They Briefly Dated When They Were Teenagers</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Don’t get too excited, because this part of their love story isn’t the "happily ever after". The country star and his now-wife actually dated when they were 15 years old. Unfortunately, their brief romance only lasted six months before the duo called it quits, choosing to remain best friends.</span></p><h2 id=their-first-kiss-was-on-a-trampoline><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><span class=s1>Their First Kiss Was On A Trampoline</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>The couple had their first kiss during their brief dating stint. And the funniest part is that it actually took place on a trampoline. Although it does seem fitting for a couple of 15-year-old kids. It must not have gone very well if they broke up not too long after.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=both-of-them-almost-married-someone-else><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><span class=s1>Both Of Them Almost Married Someone Else</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>While Thomas and Lauren remained close friends, they did start to date other people when they were in their late teens. Thomas recalls, “Mitch Barnes invited her to junior/senior banquet. And that was the turning point. I was crushed.” They both entered into serious relationships, to the point that they almost married other people.</span></p><h2 id=thomas-got-a-surprise-phone-call><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><span class=s1>Thomas Got A Surprise Phone Call</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>The two love birds actually owe their happily ever after to Lauren’s father. Thomas recalled the phone call, saying, "Her dad called me and said, 'If you don't come over here tonight and tell Lauren how you feel about her, then I'm going to tell her how you feel about her.” And the rest is history!</span></p><h2 id=quickly-moving-relationship><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><span class=s1>Quickly Moving Relationship</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>After finally landing the woman he had been chasing for over a decade (when she ended her current relationship), Thomas wasn’t going to waste any time. "We kissed, and that was it,” Thomas recalls. They only dated for about six months before he proposed and decide to snatch Lauren up for good.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thomas-proposed-with-a-wine-bottle><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><span class=s1>Thomas Proposed With A Wine Bottle</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>If you thought they were the cutest couple ever, you haven’t even heard the best part of Thomas and Lauren’s love story. He enlisted the help of his mother and invited Lauren to her favorite Italian restaurant in Nashville. Then he wrote, “Marry Me?” on a wine bottle, in silver Sharpie!</span></p><h2 id=she-wrote-her-answer-in-sharpie><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><span class=s1>She Wrote Her Answer In Sharpie</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Of course, Lauren had to answer the proposal in an appropriate manner. Although writing his proposal in Sharpie wasn’t conventional, it didn’t phase Lauren at all. She wrote back in Sharpie, “Well, duh, yes!” Thomas said, “Somebody cued ‘The Way You Look Tonight’ by Frank Sinatra, and we danced in this little cigar room. It was pretty awesome.”</span></p><h2 id=they-were-only-22-years-old-when-they-got-married><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><span class=s1>They Were Only 22 Years Old When They Got Married</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>After getting engaged so quickly, Thomas and Lauren decided to just go right into getting married as well. The “Die A Happy Man” singer married the love of his life when they were only 22 years old. After they tied the knot, they ended up going to Oahu for their honeymoon.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-everyone-believed-in-them><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><span class=s1>Not Everyone Believed In Them</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Even though the couple were certain they were making the right choice in getting married at such a young age, not everyone believed in them. But they quickly won everyone over. Thomas’ dad said, "When I saw them stare at each other the entire 20 minutes they were saying their vows, it's like these two people are meant to be together.”</span></p><h2 id=luke-bryan-gave-his-full-support><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><span class=s1>Luke Bryan Gave His Full Support</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Apparently Luke Bryan was one of the only supporters of their young love. Thomas’ father recalls, “Everybody told him no, this is not what he should do– except Luke. He called Luke three or four times, and Luke was like, ‘Buddy, if you’re in love and you want to get married, then do it.'”</span></p><h2 id=they-have-set-strict-rules-when-they-re-apart><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><span class=s1>They Have Set Strict Rules When They’re Apart</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Apparently the secret to an amazing marriage, when you’re a country star, is to set rules. Thomas said that they try to talk at least three to four times a day when he is on the road. One of his most important rules is that he keeps his distance from other women, even in his music videos.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-doesn-t-love-all-his-songs><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><span class=s1>Lauren Doesn’t Love All His Songs</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lauren Akins is usually her husband’s number one fan, even supporting him from afar when necessary. However, she’s not going to pretend she likes a song when she doesn’t. Apparently, Lauren hates “Make Me Wanna” with a passion and is continually asking Thomas to take it out of his setlist permanently.</span></p><h2 id=thomas-and-lauren-fight-like-cats-and-dogs><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><span class=s1>Thomas And Lauren Fight Like Cats And Dogs</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Both Thomas and Lauren like to be open with their followers and don’t want to put on a fake front and pretend they’re perfect. Thomas admits, “If you hang out with me and Lauren, you know our relationship. You know that we fight like cats and dogs, but you know that we’ve fought like cats and dogs since we were like 10 years old.”</span></p><h2 id=thomas-and-lauren-love-to-celebrate-valentine-s-day><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><span class=s1>Thomas And Lauren Love To Celebrate Valentine’s Day</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Lauren admitted that she loves Valentine’s Day and tries to make it special. Luckily, Thomas goes along with her plans! Lauren said, “Regardless of where we are in the world, Valentine’s Day for us is chocolates, heartfelt letters in a Valentine’s card, a good movie, flowers, and time alone with just us two.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-adopted-a-daughter-from-uganda><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><span class=s1>They Adopted A Daughter From Uganda</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Thomas and Lauren’s first child, Willa, was adopted from Uganda. It was a long process because they had to foster for a year before they could bring her home. They originally decided to adopt because they were having trouble getting pregnant. Once they saw Willa they knew that she was meant to be theirs.</span></p><h2 id=life-changes-quickly><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><span class=s1>Life Changes Quickly</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Life doesn’t always go as planned, as Thomas Rhett sings in his hit song, “Life Changes.” Right before bringing home Willa, the couple found out that Lauren was pregnant with another baby girl! Their sweet family doubled in size in just a few short months, adding two babies under the age of two.</span></p><h2 id=he-wouldn-t-die-a-happy-man-without-lauren><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><span class=s1>He Wouldn’t Die A Happy Man Without Lauren</span></span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>Thomas has said that Lauren is the inspiration for everything he does and she makes him a better person. While she is obviously the inspiration behind his hit song, “Die A Happy Man,” many people don’t know that Lauren asked him to write the song. So we wouldn’t even have this song without Lauren.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWjqr%2BxvsisoKefXZuupMDSZpibp6WperW0zqaYrGWinbK1wIyapZ1lnJbCs7HNZpikoZ6oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-surprising-facts-about-thomas-rhett-and-lauren-akins-relationship.html&text=20%20Surprising%20Facts%20About%20Thomas%20Rhett%20And%20Lauren%20Akins%27%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-surprising-facts-about-thomas-rhett-and-lauren-akins-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-surprising-facts-about-thomas-rhett-and-lauren-akins-relationship.html&title=20%20Surprising%20Facts%20About%20Thomas%20Rhett%20And%20Lauren%20Akins%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-surprising-facts-about-thomas-rhett-and-lauren-akins-relationship.html&title=20%20Surprising%20Facts%20About%20Thomas%20Rhett%20And%20Lauren%20Akins%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-surprising-facts-about-thomas-rhett-and-lauren-akins-relationship.html&title=20%20Surprising%20Facts%20About%20Thomas%20Rhett%20And%20Lauren%20Akins%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-surprising-facts-about-thomas-rhett-and-lauren-akins-relationship.html&description=20%20Surprising%20Facts%20About%20Thomas%20Rhett%20And%20Lauren%20Akins%27%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./barstool-blogs-top-barstool-blogs-and-websites.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barstool Blogs  Top Barstool Blogs and Websites">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-celebrity-deaths-allegedly-linked-to-the-illuminati.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebrity Deaths Allegedly Linked to the Illuminati">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
