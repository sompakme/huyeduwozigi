Inside there are all the usual amenities that one would expect from a motor home but also critical communication equipment that allows the president to stay in touch with his advisors and anyone else regardless of where he might be. The cost for this amazing vehicle you ask? Well, it is estimated to be somewhere around the $1.1 million figure.
