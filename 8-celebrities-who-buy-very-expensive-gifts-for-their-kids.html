For the lucky little babies that are born to celebrity parents, this is precisely the sort of lifestyle they lead in real-life! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Children born to the rich and famous</a> are instantly introduced to a lifestyle full of lavish material items and priceless goodies that most people could only dream about. As<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Insider</a> reports, when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity parents and their gifting habits</a>, it seems that there is absolutely no limit, and anything is possible. Some of these presents are so over-the-top that it's difficult to&nbsp;understand what could possibly be given to them the following year. These incredible presents are going to be really hard to beat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-amp-katie-holmes>Tom Cruise &&nbsp; Katie Holmes</h2><p>Suri's parents might not be together anymore, but when they were, they definitely joined forces and combined their enormous wealth to make sure she had the very best of everything. When she was just a little girl, she was gifted a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> massive tree house </a>from her parents. She actually had her very own home, within their home. This tree house was enormous and is said to have cost in excess of $24,000 to construct.</p><p>This is different than the average tree houses that most children play in. This one had running water, full electricity, and all the comforts of a real home, including carpets and furnishings. Perhaps this was Suri's introduction to real estate...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Celebrities Who Spent On Excessive Birthday Parties For Their Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonce-amp-jay-z>Beyonce & Jay Z</h2><p>Being the daughter of music icons Beyonce and Jay-Z, means Blue Ivy will never know what a 'normal' childhood is like. Truly living in the lap of luxury, this little girl received some wildly expensive gifts when she was just 1 year old. On her very first birthday she was given an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$80,000 diamond encrusted Barbie</a> and in all likelihood, it wasn't one she was even allowed to play with. That was only one of her gifts, and considering this milestone birthday, we're sure Blue Ivy received a series of other expensive presents, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kris-jenner>Kris Jenner</h2><p>It's no secret that Kris Jenner loves the finer things in life, and she's cultivated the careers of all her children to ensure that they can enjoy the same, lavish lifestyle. Kris Jenner makes sure every birthday is a special one for all her children, and she especially goes all-out when&nbsp;it comes to gift-giving. Sparing no expense, Kris purchased a $90,000 Range Rover for Kendall's Sweet 16 birthday. Of course, it was fully loaded and completely customized, too.</p><h2 id=victoria-amp-david-beckham>Victoria & David Beckham</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Victoria and David Beckham realized that their daughter wouldn't really benefit from toys at the tender age of 1, so they decided to cultivate her path as a potential art-lover and set her up with an iconic, valuable piece of artwork, in stead. They purchased a custom Damien Hirst painting called Daddy's Girl for the jaw-dropping cost of $600,000. The heart shaped masterpiece features butterflies and increases in value each year.</p><h2 id=sean-diddy-combs>Sean 'Diddy' Combs</h2><p>Sean Combs absolutely dotes on his son Justin. The gift he purchased for Justin's 16th birthday was so over the top that most people would have a tough time believing it, had it not been featured on MTV's My Super Sweet 16.</p><p>During his son's very lavish, over-the-top birthday bash, Sean Combs paused the event to present his son with a brand new, very shiny, and completely customized&nbsp;Maybach that is valued at $360,000.&nbsp;Given that this was his first car, we can only imagine what his next few car purchases will be like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-amp-kanye-west>Kim Kardashian & Kanye West</h2><p>This power couple does everything in a big way, and North's 6th Christmas was an absolutely legendary one. Christmas is a time when most kids excitedly tear apart the wrapping to unveil incredible toys they get to play with and enjoy. North had a very different experience. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2019, her parents gifted her Michael Jackson's leather jacket. </a>Yes, the actual jacket belonging to the pop legend was gifted to a 6 year old child.</p><p>Kim and Kanye bid $65,625 for it at an auction event and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, they claim that North is an avid fan of MJ's, so this seemed like a natural present to give to their little girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cardi-b>Cardi B</h2><p>When&nbsp;Kulture turned one year old, Cardi B decided to give her daughter an absolutely unforgettable gift that truly shines as brightly as her love for her does.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Shiny diamonds</a> were her gift of choice, so she bought her a stunning diamond and white gold necklace from jeweler Eliantte, worth roughly $100,000. It featured the characters from the Netflix show, Word Party.</p><h2 id=farrah-abraham>Farrah Abraham</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Farrah Abraham's daughter, Sophia was just 8 years old, she was surprised with an incredibly special Christmas gift that would melt the heart of any little girl her age. Instead of the usual gifts under the tree, Sophia had a surprise waiting outside. Farrah Abraham gifted her a real pony. She also was given a pink golf cart and a jacuzzi of her own. Not many 8 year old children can lay claims on having their very own pony, but Sophia sure can! Farrah continues to purchase lavish items for her daughter.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Very Expensive & Weird Things Celebrity Purchased</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cafe Mom</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Circu</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Insider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwprjEm6mirJmawG6u1LJkpKGUqHqmxM%2Bepayhppp6qLXFrapo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f8-celebrities-who-buy-very-expensive-gifts-for-their-kids.html&text=8%20Celebrities%20Who%20Buy%20Very%20Expensive%20Gifts%20For%20Their%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-celebrities-who-buy-very-expensive-gifts-for-their-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-celebrities-who-buy-very-expensive-gifts-for-their-kids.html&title=8%20Celebrities%20Who%20Buy%20Very%20Expensive%20Gifts%20For%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f8-celebrities-who-buy-very-expensive-gifts-for-their-kids.html&title=8%20Celebrities%20Who%20Buy%20Very%20Expensive%20Gifts%20For%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f8-celebrities-who-buy-very-expensive-gifts-for-their-kids.html&title=8%20Celebrities%20Who%20Buy%20Very%20Expensive%20Gifts%20For%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-celebrities-who-buy-very-expensive-gifts-for-their-kids.html&description=8%20Celebrities%20Who%20Buy%20Very%20Expensive%20Gifts%20For%20Their%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-poses-in-a-lime-green-mini-dress-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears Poses in a Lime Green Mini Dress: Photo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-ossi-v%C3%A4%C3%A4n%C3%A4nen-everything-about-the-finnish-former-professional-ice-hockey-defenceman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Ossi Vnnen?
