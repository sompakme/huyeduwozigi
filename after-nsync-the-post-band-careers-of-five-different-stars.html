However, when they decided to break up in 2002 and embark on their separate paths, <a href=#>they knew they could still use the fame they had earned together</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NSync began was in 1995 with Chris Kirkpatrick, whom Lou Pearlman discovered as a raw talent and immediately set him up to find himself a group of individuals who could match his level of greatness for forming a band.</p><p>The first person that Kirkpatrick contacted was Justin Timberlake, who was part of the TV show ‘The Mickey Mouse Club" at the time. JC Chasez came with Timberlake in the deal as the two were trying to establish a career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>On their lookout for a baritone, the three ventured to Orlando, Florida, and found Joey Fatone. The next person who Timberlake’s vocal coach recommended was the 16-year-old Lance Bass. This led to the historical formation of N’Sync, and the extraordinary group earned unparalleled fame and wealth till 2002, when they finally broke up to walk their separate paths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ex-team members of this beloved boyband did not have a bitter breakup like most other bands and are reportedly still on good, amicable terms. Here is how each one of them has found their success after the band’s splitting.</p><h2 id=joey-fatone>Joey Fatone</h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Highest Paid Reality TV Stars On Cameo</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Joey Fatone</a> admits to being stalled for some time before he could branch out to a successful solo career after N’Sync. Fatone and the rest of the group were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">waiting for Justin</a> Timberlake to be back so they could resume making music together. But after a while, it seemed like he was not coming back, and the group eventually disbanded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Immediately after Fatone invested in building his place in the show business, his big break came with the part he played in My Big Fat Greek Wedding in 2002. Fatone’s post-NSync career has been quite versatile as he has also indulged in musicals like Rent and Little Shop of Horrors. In addition, he has also been a host in TV shows like The Singing Bee and Celebrity Circus.</p><p>Fatone married his childhood sweetheart Kelly Baldwin in 2004 and had two kids together, but the two divorced in 2019. The couple had been separated for a while, and in 2014 Fatone began dating Izabel Araujo.</p><h2 id=lance-bass>Lance Bass</h2><p>Lance Bass is another member of the group who did not go back to pop music after N’Sync. Instead, he tried his luck in the acting business and starred in the movie On The Line with Joey Fatone. However, later he focussed on becoming a TV and radio personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bass made a breakthrough in the entertainment industry through his 2008 performance on the seventh season of Dancing With The Stars, where he became the second runner-up. Bass <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also launched</a> his radio show called Dirty Pop with Lance Bass and a reality TV cooking show called My Kitchen Rules, where he collaborated with his mother. But most famous is his nuptial series with husband Michael Turchin called Lance Loves Michael: The <a href=#>Lance Bass</a> Wedding.</p><h2 id=chris-kirkpatrick>Chris Kirkpatrick</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Kirkpatrick</a> was a part of N’Sync from the very beginning and could be seen as the starting point of the boy band. However, after the group split up, Kirkpatrick abandoned the limelight forever. One of the reasons he never faced the camera again was that he was adversely affected by the breaking up of the band and took some time to make his peace because they were never getting back together again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kirkpatrick has a son with his wife, Karly. It seems he is spending some quality time with his family and focusing on bringing up his son away from all the glamor and attention of the media. He got back in business from 2007 to 2008 when he performed in Mission Man Band. He has also been on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music shows like</a> CMT’s Gone Country.</p><h2 id=jc-chasez>JC Chasez</h2><p><a href=#>JC Chasez</a>, unlike Chris Kirkpatrick, did not see the group’s split as a bad thing. He was looking forward to it as he felt ready to embark on a solo career. He was as invested in N’Sync as the other members, but he also saw the eventual split as organic - something that was destined to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chasez’s attitude stems from a thirst for adventure in trying out new and different things, and he fared pretty well even after the group broke up. In 2004, he released his debut album called ‘Schizophrenic,’ and his second album came out three years later. Later, he took to songwriting and producing and became a judge for five seasons on a reality TV show called ‘America’s Best Dance Crew.’</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake>Justin Timberlake</h2><p><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> has been the man of the hour ever since he left N’Sync. Although Chris Kirkpatrick waited a while for him to finally get back from his solo journey to make N’Sync glorious again, it was not to happen. Instead, Timberlake became too famous for returning and being part of a group even though he was very fond of his bandmates and the band itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Timberlake was the first one to leave the band and begin his solo career in 2002. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released his solo album</a> that very year which featured superhits like ‘Rock Your Body’ and ‘Cry Me A River.’ and sold over 7 million copies. His big-screen breakthrough was the 2010 movie The Social Network, after which he went to act in other popular films like Friends With Benefits alongside Mila Kunis and Trolls alongside Anna Kendrick. In 2012, Timberlake met the love of his life, Jessica Biel, and in 2015 the couple welcomed their son to the world.</p><p>Although the five of them have no plans of reuniting to create music together, they are closely associated. Beyond their professional relationships as former bandmates, they have stuck by each other through thick and thin, with their varying success in life.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Music Videos Ever Made</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Showbiz Cheatsheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gossip Cop</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSup8DEq2Snq6mjsG7AyKaZnqqclrimecWaq6imlWKwqa3VnrFmmpGowG63yKuiqZmkp7akt44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fafter-nsync-the-post-band-careers-of-five-different-stars.html&text=After%20NSYNC%3a%20The%20Post-Band%20Careers%20Of%20Five%20Different%20Stars&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fafter-nsync-the-post-band-careers-of-five-different-stars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fafter-nsync-the-post-band-careers-of-five-different-stars.html&title=After%20NSYNC%3a%20The%20Post-Band%20Careers%20Of%20Five%20Different%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fafter-nsync-the-post-band-careers-of-five-different-stars.html&title=After%20NSYNC%3a%20The%20Post-Band%20Careers%20Of%20Five%20Different%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fafter-nsync-the-post-band-careers-of-five-different-stars.html&title=After%20NSYNC%3a%20The%20Post-Band%20Careers%20Of%20Five%20Different%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fafter-nsync-the-post-band-careers-of-five-different-stars.html&description=After%20NSYNC%3a%20The%20Post-Band%20Careers%20Of%20Five%20Different%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./craig-berube-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Craig Berube Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./5-things-you-didn-t-know-about-peta-wilson-what-is-she-doing-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Things You Didnt Know About Peta Wilson, What Is She Doing Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
