In 1997, he decided to stop drinking for the first time after working with <a href=#>his longtime best friend, Matt Damon</a> on Good Will Hunting. He went to rehab for the first time in 2001, which would begin his many trips there. But his most prominent stints were in 2017 and 2018 following his split from <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a></strong> in 2015, after 10 years of marriage.</p><p>Back then, the Pearl Harbor star had a two-month fling with 22-year-old Playboy model, Shauna Sexton – who was blamed for his relapses. Later on, a source revealed that the two-time Oscar winner's "always up and down" moods "scarred" his ex when they were together. Sexton also held Affleck – who's reportedly <a href=#>having marriage issues</a> with <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> – accountable for his bad decisions via social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-28t152959-519.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Even Howard Stern Gasped At The Offer Ben Stiller Turned Down From Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Because Of One Condition ">Even Howard Stern Gasped At The Offer Ben Stiller Turned Down From Matt Damon And Ben Affleck Because Of One Condition</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Howard Stern didn't hide his expression after Ben Stiller revealed the major film he passed on.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-allegedly-had-a-party-lifestyle-while-dating-shauna-sexton>Ben Affleck Allegedly Had A Party Lifestyle While Dating Shauna Sexton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shauna-sexton-and-ben-affleck-1.jpg><p>In an Us Weekly exclusive in December 2018, a source revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck "really scarred" Sexton</a> because of his "always up and down" moods. "Sometimes he [wanted] to go out, drink and get girls, and other times [he was] completely sober and going to church," said the insider. The Batman actor broke up with the model in October 2018, days after completing his rehab treatment.</p><p>When Affleck first stopped drinking in 1997, he admitted to "regretting some things [he] did when [he] was drunk. He explained: "It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it’' like, 'I think I hurt that person's feelings,' 'I made a fool of myself' or 'I didn't want to kiss that girl.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me," Affleck said of alcohol's effect on him.</p><p>In March 2017, The Accountant star said there's "no shame" in seeking help for alcoholism via Facebook: "I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be. I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that he was "lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen [Garner], who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do. This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery." Obviously, his progress didn't continue the following year, for which Sexton was heavily criticized.</p><p>Ben Affleck admitted that his "drinking... created more marital problems" between him and Jennifer Garner.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/fans-understood-the-true-meaning-behind-amy-poehler-s-_harsh_-matt-damon-joke-at-the-golden-globes-front-deposit-back-jimmy-kimmel-live_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Ben Affleck Backed Up Amy Poehler&#39;s "Harsh" Matt Damon Joke At The Golden Globes '>Ben Affleck Backed Up Amy Poehler's "Harsh" Matt Damon Joke At The Golden Globes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Ben Affleck confirmed that Amy Poehler calling Matt Damon a "garbage person" had some truth in it.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-39-s-sober-counselor-advised-him-to-break-up-with-shauna-sexton>Ben Affleck's Sober Counselor Advised Him To Break Up With Shauna Sexton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ben-affleck-and-shauna-sexton.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October 2018, Page Six published an article called, "Why Ben Affleck's Shauna Sexton fling was bad for his health — and his image," which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">further vilified Sexton online</a>. The outlet cited ET reporting that "Garner and Affleck's sober counselors urged him to cut ties with Sexton." A source added: "He has a lot of money and right now he's still young enough that he needs to get his s**t together. One day he will drink too much and something bad will happen."</p><p>But Sexton's photographer friend, Martin Murillo, said that Affleck's relapse made things difficult for the model, who is not the "attention-loving" person Page Six itself described. "Now that this whole thing has happened, it's gotten harder," said Murillo. "If I’m talking to an agent from LA Models, the first thing they [note] is that she's dating Ben ­Affleck."</p><p>"It could be a good thing, but I think they see it as, 'Oh, here's just another model wanting attention.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that the paparazzi frenzy caused Sexton to quit her day job as a technician at Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center of Thousand Oaks, California.

"At the end of the day, in order to be in recovery, [Affleck] needs to be by himself and taking care of his family," they stated. "He's being used by this girl. Anyone who drinks the way she drinks and is out there publicizing it and their relationship, has no respect for him or his family."</p><p>The fitness trainer "has been arrested for underage drinking and public intoxication, and has bragged on social media about her love of drinking and party­ing," per the publication. But Sexton defended herself, telling Instagram commenters that she loves "to drink and party! Absolutely dude," before dragging Affleck.</p><p>"Do these mistakes mean I would disrespect someone's hard earned sobriety by drinking with them or in front of them? Hell no," she said. "I have limitless respect for those who take action and actually do something about it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"With that being said, Ben is a grown ass man, baby.

You are human. We all are going to f–k up, it's just a matter of learning from it," Sexton wrote. "Don't be so quick to throw shade on people. Take a step back, accept that we are all on our own..."</p><p>Ben Affleck reportedly cheated on Lindsay Shookus with a rehab employee in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqZdlrOnuMScoqxlkZmxqq%2FToqanZaOYrrO%2BxJ1koaGjYn9zediemKtln6GxbrHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1krKCRqruiedKer62nnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fben-affleck-s-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-shauna-sexton.html&text=Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Addiction%20%26quot%3bScarred%26quot%3b%20His%2022-Year-Old%20Ex%20Shauna%20Sexton&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fben-affleck-s-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-shauna-sexton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fben-affleck-s-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-shauna-sexton.html&title=Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Addiction%20%26quot%3bScarred%26quot%3b%20His%2022-Year-Old%20Ex%20Shauna%20Sexton" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fben-affleck-s-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-shauna-sexton.html&title=Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Addiction%20%26quot%3bScarred%26quot%3b%20His%2022-Year-Old%20Ex%20Shauna%20Sexton" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fben-affleck-s-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-shauna-sexton.html&title=Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Addiction%20%26quot%3bScarred%26quot%3b%20His%2022-Year-Old%20Ex%20Shauna%20Sexton" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fben-affleck-s-addiction-scarred-his-22-year-old-ex-shauna-sexton.html&description=Ben%20Affleck%27s%20Addiction%20%26quot%3bScarred%26quot%3b%20His%2022-Year-Old%20Ex%20Shauna%20Sexton" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./check-out-the-mansion-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-will-host-their-wedding-reception-in.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Check Out The Mansion Justin Bieber &amp;amp; Hailey Baldwin Will Host Their Wedding Reception In">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./unexpected-star-compares-it-to-teen-mom-our-show-s-real.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Unexpected Star Compares It to Teen Mom: Our Shows Real">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
