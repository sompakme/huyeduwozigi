You struck me as a warm and joyful person, and that was very attractive."</p><p>However, it appears that the writing maverick's feelings for Arielle were not enough to prevent their split, marking the third divorce for Lorre.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Raj Wear So Many Layers on The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><p>Before his marriage with Arielle, Chuck was in a long-term marriage with Paula Smith. The couple, who got married in 1979 before divorcing in 1992, shares two children, Nicole and Asa.</p><p>After his split from Paula, Chuck met and married Karen Witter, a Playboy Playmate, in 2001.

Having a prenup would definitely make this easier for both parties.</p><p>In the prenup, Chuck had agreed to pay spousal support and attorney's fees for Arielle, making it easier for her to move on.</p><p>Another thing that may have helped the couple make decisions about their divorce was the fact that they have no children, so custody was not going to be an issue.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-arielle-lorre-worth-today>How Much Is Arielle Lorre Worth Today?</h2><p>Not a lot is known about Arielle Lorre's business beyond her activity on YouTube, but she is believed to have a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close to $3 million as of 2023</a>.
