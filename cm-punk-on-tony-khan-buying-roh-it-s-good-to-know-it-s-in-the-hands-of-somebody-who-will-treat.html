Punk spoke about his love for Ring Of Honor and then spoke about how Tony Khan’s purchase of the promotion makes him feel at ease. He said he feels like his legacy is in good hands, then spoke in general about how Khan has fostered a welcoming environment for talent in All Elite Wrestling.</p><p>“I loved ROH so much, you know? I can’t explain how happy I am that my footage—it’s in good hands. It’s just good to know that it’s in the hands of somebody that who will treat it well. I literally feel like my baby is in somebody’s hands that I know will raise the child the right way and do good things with it,” Punk stated. “It won’t get made into some tab on a shitty confusing app that’s hard to navigate and the boys don’t get paid anything off of it.</p><p>“It’s very good, but to pay homage to myself and stuff like that? I didn’t get to do this for seven years, this didn’t exist for seven years for me. Obviously, the truth is that I love professional wrestling very much, so to come back and to be able to for six months… it’s not just do whatever the f-ck you want, it’s do whatever the f-ck you want and being cocky enough to know that your way is not the right way. There’s never only one way, but it’s f-cking good. And to have somebody that listens to you, to have somebody that can take an idea and make it even better, just to have an open dialogue, not just with him, but with other people in the locker room,” Punk explained, “it’s great that you don’t have to beat your head against the wall and explain why your ideas are shitty, why I don’t care who you think you are and you don’t know what you’re doing. It’s nice, everything’s just so great. I don’t even know if I answered your question.” [laughs]</p><p>Later in the scrum, Punk spoke about not wanting WWE to own more of his footage because they owned enough of it and he didn’t get paid for it. He then referenced how he had the same conversations about getting paid royalties before WWE Network launched, and how it resulted in those checks getting smaller and a lot of unanswered questions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxanBqYGKwrnnPrqWkZZ%2BjerW7zbJkpKCRo3qjwdiipaBloqS1brPOqJtmoJGjsbQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcm-punk-on-tony-khan-buying-roh-it-s-good-to-know-it-s-in-the-hands-of-somebody-who-will-treat.html&text=CM%20Punk%20On%20Tony%20Khan%20Buying%20ROH%3a%20Its%20Good%20To%20Know%20Its%20In%20The%20Hands%20Of%20Somebody%20Who%20Will%20Treat%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcm-punk-on-tony-khan-buying-roh-it-s-good-to-know-it-s-in-the-hands-of-somebody-who-will-treat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcm-punk-on-tony-khan-buying-roh-it-s-good-to-know-it-s-in-the-hands-of-somebody-who-will-treat.html&title=CM%20Punk%20On%20Tony%20Khan%20Buying%20ROH%3a%20Its%20Good%20To%20Know%20Its%20In%20The%20Hands%20Of%20Somebody%20Who%20Will%20Treat%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcm-punk-on-tony-khan-buying-roh-it-s-good-to-know-it-s-in-the-hands-of-somebody-who-will-treat.html&title=CM%20Punk%20On%20Tony%20Khan%20Buying%20ROH%3a%20Its%20Good%20To%20Know%20Its%20In%20The%20Hands%20Of%20Somebody%20Who%20Will%20Treat%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcm-punk-on-tony-khan-buying-roh-it-s-good-to-know-it-s-in-the-hands-of-somebody-who-will-treat.html&title=CM%20Punk%20On%20Tony%20Khan%20Buying%20ROH%3a%20Its%20Good%20To%20Know%20Its%20In%20The%20Hands%20Of%20Somebody%20Who%20Will%20Treat%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcm-punk-on-tony-khan-buying-roh-it-s-good-to-know-it-s-in-the-hands-of-somebody-who-will-treat.html&description=CM%20Punk%20On%20Tony%20Khan%20Buying%20ROH%3a%20Its%20Good%20To%20Know%20Its%20In%20The%20Hands%20Of%20Somebody%20Who%20Will%20Treat%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dolph-ziggler-page-48-of-207.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dolph Ziggler - Page 48 of 207">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bell-hooks-cause-of-death-how-did-bell-hooks-die.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bell Hooks Cause of Death, How did Bell Hooks Die?
