A living legend, he successfully built his business empire worth $9.53 billion today. <a href=#>As many successful men are known to own yachts</a>, Armani was no different. After visiting others and chartering a few for several years, he decided to design his yacht. The designer believed that none of them suited his style. He concluded that yachts were too white and had flashy designs. As a fan of elegant simplicity, <a href=#>he designed a yacht to let the interior do the talking</a>. Unlike anything seen before, Maìn's design is truly one of a kind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From creating comfortable yet luxurious rooms to using innovative technology for the amenities, the yacht designed by Giorgio Armani is perfection on water. Let’s take a glimpse inside the $65 million and what truly makes it an elegant home on the water.</p><h2 id=designed-by-armani>Designed by Armani</h2><p>Giorgio Armani decided to design the superyacht himself when he needed to own a yacht that would cater to his needs. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">L’Official USA</a>, it took 30 months to create and design the yacht, and it was completed in 2008 with the help of the construction company Codecasa. The 65-meter hull has a unique color scheme, and Armani took it upon himself to design every inch, including the blinds and windows that offer a scenic view of the ocean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=named-with-nostalgia-designed-to-perfection>Named With Nostalgia, Designed To Perfection</h2><p>The designer has multiple yachts in his collection, and one of the yachts is called Mariù, which was his mother’s nickname for him. He named his 65-meter yacht Maìn after his mother’s other affectionate nickname, which is a constant reminder for Armani of his humble <a href=#>beginnings in Italy</a>. Armani has mentioned that his mother was an elegant woman, and he has used her approach to create interiors and fashion over the years. In the study of his cabin in Maìn, Armani has a picture of his mother on the desk.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Supercar Of The Sea: Inside Conor McGregor's $3.6 Million Lamborghini Tecnomar 63 Yacht</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=strong-and-compact-appearance>Strong and Compact Appearance</h2><p>Armani wanted to design the yacht to look like a military boat. As he was in the army during the 1950s, his idea to paint the yacht army green comes from the same roots, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>. As the Maìn is not meant to be flashy, Armani decided to use a camouflage shade to blend the boat and the sea to remain reclusive from the other bright yachts around.</p><h2 id=luxurious-interior>Luxurious Interior</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A luxury enterprise in every form, the yacht has crystal glass at the top to give better visibility of the sea. The floors feature natural birchwood, bulkheads, and Venetian blinds. The galley is designed with retro lacquered glass, while the main deck features an electric fireplace. The ceilings are colored in the shades of metal grey, while the other areas are in the shade of army green to echo the exterior.</p><h2 id=comfortable-accommodation>Comfortable Accommodation</h2><p>The overall interior of the yacht looks like it does not have walls. Armani found it challenging to find space to create his designs since most of the work done by Codecasa was under the floors. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yacht Harbor</a>, the vessel has seven cabins that can accommodate 12 people and separate cabins for 14 crew members. Along with the unique color scheme, people on board can enjoy the marble bathrooms, cinema room, and gym. The heart of the yacht is the living room that features decor from Armani Casa. The main deck has two separate areas, the fireplace space and the sitting room. Most of the furniture aboard the Maìn is customized by <a href=#>the Interior Designer</a> specialists at Armani Casa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=powerful-machinery>Powerful Machinery</h2><p>Not only does the Maìn offer an unforgettable experience on the boat, but it also ensures a safe passage over the ocean with its potent engine and built. The yacht is equipped with 2 Caterpillar engines that give her a maximum speed of 17 knots. With a volume of 1,147 knots, it has a range of 6,000 miles at 14 knots. It offers enough power for Armani to travel between his favorite homes located in Saint Tropez and the Italian island Pantelleria.</p><h2 id=precious-stone-panels>Precious Stone Panels</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Growing up on the Mediterranean Sea, Armani has always loved the water. While creating the yacht, he arranged spaces that would provide visual freedom. His favorite part of the Maìn is the veranda-attached living space and his cabin that is designed with skillfully crafted paneling that is made from precious materials. The interior of his cabin also features an antique Japanese cabinet, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boat International</a>.</p><h2 id=unconventional-amenities>Unconventional Amenities</h2><p>One of the most prominent aspects of any vessel is the decks. <a href=#>Every luxurious superyacht </a>is always equipped with multiple decks; however, Armani never built decks for Maìn. To not disturb the purity of the design and structure, he removed the characteristics seen in an old ship. The technical parts mainly on display are tucked in the stern garage under the staircase that takes people straight to the water from the yacht.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Giorgio Armani’s superyacht Maìn is an experience in itself. He worked closely with his designers to create a home on the water to design it. The designer is frequently seen aboard the yacht, spending his summer vacations with family and friends. In March 2021, he teamed up with The Italian Sea Group to design a 236-foot yacht that will debut in 2024.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Aerial Arsenal: Inside Bill Gates' Aircraft Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">L’Official USA</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yacht Harbor</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boat International</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxprLIp5ysZZWhsqitzZycZqeeYrWqs8dmqp6Zo2K2r7%2FInZxmn5mkv6i1zmaYq6WRo7a0eZVuZKahnKG2sLqMspicoKRiuqK1zWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdefines-elegance-on-high-seas-inside-giorgio-armani-s-65-million-yacht-main.html&text=Defines%20Elegance%20On%20High%20Seas%3a%20Inside%20Giorgio%20Armani%27s%20%2465%20Million%20Yacht%20%27Main%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdefines-elegance-on-high-seas-inside-giorgio-armani-s-65-million-yacht-main.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdefines-elegance-on-high-seas-inside-giorgio-armani-s-65-million-yacht-main.html&title=Defines%20Elegance%20On%20High%20Seas%3a%20Inside%20Giorgio%20Armani%27s%20%2465%20Million%20Yacht%20%27Main%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdefines-elegance-on-high-seas-inside-giorgio-armani-s-65-million-yacht-main.html&title=Defines%20Elegance%20On%20High%20Seas%3a%20Inside%20Giorgio%20Armani%27s%20%2465%20Million%20Yacht%20%27Main%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdefines-elegance-on-high-seas-inside-giorgio-armani-s-65-million-yacht-main.html&title=Defines%20Elegance%20On%20High%20Seas%3a%20Inside%20Giorgio%20Armani%27s%20%2465%20Million%20Yacht%20%27Main%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdefines-elegance-on-high-seas-inside-giorgio-armani-s-65-million-yacht-main.html&description=Defines%20Elegance%20On%20High%20Seas%3a%20Inside%20Giorgio%20Armani%27s%20%2465%20Million%20Yacht%20%27Main%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-john-mayer-and-jake-gyllenhaal-bond-over-being-targets-of-some-of-taylor-swift-s-most-cutting-so.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did John Mayer And Jake Gyllenhaal Bond Over Being Targets Of Some of Taylor Swift's Most Cutting So">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chanel-iman-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chanel Iman News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
