The headaches and the heartbreak and the sense of failure—as a mother, a wife, and a woman—would just evaporate.”</p><p>In her memoir, Moore delves into the emotional toll the incident took on her family, particularly her daughter Rumer, who was also at the party.</p><p>“I scared Rumer so badly when she saw me there, semiconscious on the floor; she thought I might die in front of her.
