He did commercials early on in his career, <a href=#>appearing shirtless for Pringles</a> before starring in a campaign for Levi’s a few years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that was happening though, Pitt was also steadily pursuing television and film. Throughout his career, the Oscar winner would go on to be known for movies such as Legends of the Fall, Se7en, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, Oceans’ Eleven, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, War Machine, and more recently, Ad Astra. But does anyone remember the very first movie role that Pitt ever booked?</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-only-booked-minor-and-uncredited-roles-in-the-beginning>Brad Pitt Only Booked Minor And Uncredited Roles In The Beginning</h2><p>For Pitt, his early years in Hollywood consisted of small roles in both tv and film. For instance, he was just known as the “boy at the beach” in the 1987 fantasy comedy Hunk before appearing a couple of times as Chris in the Emmy-nominated series Another World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Is Brad Pitt Putting Plan B Entertainment Up For Sale Despite Numerous Awards?</a></span></p><p>That same year, Pitt also appeared as an extra in films such as No Man’s Land, No Way Out, and Less Than Zero before landing small roles in Dallas and 21 Jump Street. He also had a minor role in the TV movie A Stoning in Fulham County.</p><p>Back then, Pitt was getting jobs, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nothing stood out</a>. “I was in acting class. I was still doing extra work,” the actor recalled. His people also thought that he would be perfect for TV comedy, but Pitt didn’t agree.</p><p>“You know, when I first started, they were trying to get me into sitcoms — I think because I had that kind of Wonder Bread look and my hair always went into place. I kept saying, ‘I’m not good at sitcoms. I don’t know how to do that.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Pitt didn’t have to go into sitcoms (although <a href=#>he later made a hit guest appearance on Friends</a>), thanks to the starring role he booked next.</p><h2 id=what-was-brad-pitt-rsquo-s-first-movie>What Was Brad Pitt’s First Movie?</h2><p>After landing several gigs as an extra and working on television for years, Pitt finally managed to land his first movie role in Bozidar 'Bota' Nikolic’s 1988 drama romance The Dark Side of the Sun. The film stars the actor as Rick, a man searching for a cure for his rare skin disease.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Is The Reason Logan Lerman Appeared In Bullet Train</a></span></p><p>And while it was filmed in the 80s, Pitt’s first film was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">never shown in the US until several years later</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Due to the war breaking out in the former Yugoslavia, Dark Side of the Sun, unfortunately, was never shown here, and had its US premiere was only in 1997. In fact, the Americans stole the film from me, because I am its co-owner, but they never gave me a penny, Nikolic once said.</p><p>“But today I can say that I regret almost nothing in my career.” Perhaps, it’s because the movie led to the discovery of Pitt.</p><p>When Pitt auditioned for Nikolic’s movie, he didn’t have many acting credits yet. But the director knew he was the one, nonetheless. “I was at the Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and out of 400 actors who were at the casting for this film, I chose him,” the director recalled.</p><p>He also declared, “I discovered Brad Pitt.”</p><p>As for Pitt, doing the movie was also an experience to remember. “It was my second time on a plane,” the actor explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was my first time out of the country. I had to get a passport. It was a great, great time for me. We started in Belgrade and shot mainly in Montenegro.”</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-rsquo-s-breakout-role-in-thelma-amp-louise-came-just-a-few-years-later>Brad Pitt’s Breakout Role In Thelma & Louise Came Just A Few Years Later</h2><p>Sure, Pitt had already booked his first lead role at this time, but he was still a relative unknown. And when Ridley Scott was casting for the part of J.D. in Thelma & Louise, the actor wasn’t even at the top of his casting list.</p><p>When Pitt first read the script for the movie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he knew he had to be in it</a>. As the actor recalled, it was “incredibly well written, especially when compared to what I had access to at the time. And, most importantly, it was close to home (the actor is an Oklahoma native).”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, auditioned “with high hopes,” only for Scott to give the role to Billy Baldwin.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Didn't Want To Appear In The Lost City (But His Hairstylist Convinced Him)</a></span></p><p>Later on, Baldwin dropped out and Scott cast another actor to take his place, but it wasn’t Pitt. Interestingly, that second actor would end up exiting the project too and this time around, casting agent Lou DiGiamo asked Pitt to read one of the film’s main stars, Geena Davis. The actor left Davis flustered.</p><p>“I did fine with the first few guys but the last one was so cute,” Davis recalled. “I kept messing up my lines. I'm dying because I'm thinking, He's great, and I'm ruining his audition. I kept saying, ‘I'm so sorry!’ But he's so chill: ‘Hey, don't worry about it. It's all good.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pitt got cast in the end and from then, the roles never stopped coming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSiv4ybqZqcXaW2tcDSZp2iqqOpeq671aKcZqqfobJw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-anyone-even-remember-brad-pitt-s-first-movie-role.html&text=Does%20Anyone%20Even%20Remember%20Brad%20Pitt%27s%20First%20Movie%20Role%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-anyone-even-remember-brad-pitt-s-first-movie-role.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-anyone-even-remember-brad-pitt-s-first-movie-role.html&title=Does%20Anyone%20Even%20Remember%20Brad%20Pitt%27s%20First%20Movie%20Role%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-anyone-even-remember-brad-pitt-s-first-movie-role.html&title=Does%20Anyone%20Even%20Remember%20Brad%20Pitt%27s%20First%20Movie%20Role%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-anyone-even-remember-brad-pitt-s-first-movie-role.html&title=Does%20Anyone%20Even%20Remember%20Brad%20Pitt%27s%20First%20Movie%20Role%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-anyone-even-remember-brad-pitt-s-first-movie-role.html&description=Does%20Anyone%20Even%20Remember%20Brad%20Pitt%27s%20First%20Movie%20Role%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-kelly-ripa-and-mark-consuelos-found-an-all-nude-beach-in-greece.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos Found an 'All Nude' Beach in Greece">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dianna-williams-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dianna Williams Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
