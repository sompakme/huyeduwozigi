While Lohan was known for her wild partying and tabloid scandals, Valderrama was seen as more reserved and low-key. Despite this, the two seemed to hit it off right away, with reports suggesting that they were inseparable during their brief time together.</p><p>However, like many Hollywood romances, Valderrama and Lohan's relationship ultimately came to an end. While neither party ever publicly spoke about what led to their breakup, US Weekly reported that Valderrama had grown tired of Lohan's erratic behavior.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Netflix Pay Wilmer Valderrama A Fortune To Reprise His Role Of Fez From That '70s Show?</a></span></p><p>Despite the end of their relationship, some fans continue to wonder whether Valderrama still harbors feelings for Lohan.
