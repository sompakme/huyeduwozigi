However, venturing into daytime TV was the real game changer that pegged <strong>her annual salary between $75 million to $90 million</strong>. The Ellen DeGeneres Show, named after the award-winning host, was a ray of sunshine among millions of fans. The syndicated talk show included fun segments like <a href=#>celebrity chat sessions that were sometimes controversial</a>, pranks, dance breaks and heart-melting humanitarian causes. All of these were anchored on DeGeneres's famous mantra, "Be Kind."</p><p>However, in a dramatic turn of events, the fun atmosphere appeared to be a smokescreen after insiders who worked on the set of the show revealed their undesirable experiences. What happened to The Ellen Show? There were <strong>claims of hostility and harassment with Ellen DeGeneres and three major producers at the center of it all</strong>. There were also <a href=#>claims that the TV star showed her true colors during commercial breaks.</a> These revelations tainted the wholesome content DeGeneres displayed before she bowed out of TV two years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ellen-degeneres.jpg><p>According to The Richest, <strong>by the time Ellen DeGeneres ended her show, she earned $50 million annually</strong>, and she parted ways with the hefty sum, albeit facing backlash for her workplace issues. DeGeneres was primarily known for her eponymous show, but it was not her sole source of income.
