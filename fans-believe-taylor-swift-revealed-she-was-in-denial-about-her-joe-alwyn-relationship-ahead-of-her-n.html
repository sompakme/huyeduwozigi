Whether this includes <a href=#>how her parents' separation impacted her music </a>or how her breakups inspired her best and <a href=#>highest-ranked songs on Spotify,</a> Swift has been exceedingly transparent. But this doesn't mean she divulges everything. In fact, she has left a lot unsaid, leaving the door open for die-hard Swifites to fill in the gaps. And all of this has only <a href=#>helped her add to her $1.1 billion net worth</a>.</p><p>Ahead of the <strong>April 19th, 2024 release of her new album, "The Tortured Poets Department"</strong>, Swift sorted her earlier songs on Apple Music into five categories, each representing one of the stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In doing so, Swift may have revealed that she was in denial about her previous six-year relationship with <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>. At least, this is what fans believe. This article will delve into why fans are certain <strong>Swift was "in denial" about her relationship with her ex-boyfriend</strong>. Following this, we will explore the<strong> songs inspired by Joe Alwyn</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-may-have-revealed-she-was-in-quot-denial-quot-about-joe-alwyn-through-her-songs>Taylor Swift May Have Revealed She Was In "Denial" About Joe Alwyn Through Her Songs</h2><p>Prior to the release of her 11th studio album on April 19th, 2024, Taylor Swift decided to pair with Apple Music for a little promotion. Together they <strong>sorted her existing work into five categories, each representing one of the stages of grief</strong>. This is pretty fitting given the true inspiration behind many of her best songs -- that being, relationships, of course. According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the title for the first stage of grief, denial, is "I Love You, It's Ruining My Life Songs"</a>. Fans noticed that <strong>most of the songs in this category were written during her six-year-long relationship with actor Joe Alwyn</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_all-the-taylor-swift-songs-joe-alwyn-co-wrote-and-how-much-money-he-s-still-making-off-of-them_bk_a1_v2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Joe Alwyn may not be ranked as the <a href=#>most popular of Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriends</a>, there's no doubt that he's the most talked about. Aside from Swift's current relationship with NFL superstar Travis Kelce, <strong>Alwyn is the most hotly-debated ex-boyfriend in Swift's relationship history</strong>. Some fans are furious with Alwyn for allegedly being the reason why their relationship didn't last. Others believe Swift made a mistake in leaving him and dating a man so vastly different.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Taylor Swift dropped hints about the meaning of her 'Denial' category on Apple Music.</p><p>"This is a list of songs about getting so caught up in the idea of something that you have a hard time seeing the red flags, possibly resulting in moments of denial [and] delusion. Results may vary.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_taylor-swift-fans-are-convinced-they-know-the-real-reason-why-the-singer-and-joe-alwyn-broke-up_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Swifties Are Convinced Joe Alwyn Cheated On Taylor Swift After He Breaks Silence On Her New Album</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It appears Taylor hinted at his infidelity at her latest tour stop, and she's expected to reveal more on her forthcoming album.</span><p>Taylor Swift fans were quick to search for trends in the category's music. According to numerous Reddit threads and posts on X, man Swifites discovered that the <strong>majority of the 18 songs included on the "Denial" list were written during her relationship with Alwyn</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20-things-to-know-about-joe-alwyn-before-he-met-taylor-swift-1.jpg><p>Unsurprisingly, <strong>the list starts with 2022's "Lavender Haze", a song purely about being in the "honeymoon" stage of a relationship</strong>. Swift has also stated that the song was inspired by her six-year-long relationship. The song was part of October 202's "Midnights" album which was written during their relationship and featured many songs about Alwyn.</p><p>In a social media video that was deleted after their breakup, Swift said the following:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I guess theoretically, when you’re in the lavender haze, you’ll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud. I think a lot of people have to deal with this now, not just ‘public figures,’ because we live in the era of social media. If the world finds out that you’re in love with somebody, they’re going to weigh in on it."</p><p>Swift went on to claim that the song is about "ignoring the stuff to protect the real stuff". It also has direct references to getting married.</p><p>The other song that is linked to getting married in Swift's music catalog is <strong>"Lover", another song on the "Denial" list.</strong> According to Us Weekly, the track was written about committing herself to Joe Alwyn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_all-the-taylor-swift-songs-joe-alwyn-co-wrote-and-how-much-money-he-s-still-making-off-of-them_bk_a1_v2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other songs on Apple Music's "Denial" list include "False God", which is also suspected to be about her relationship with Alwyn, "Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince", and "Cruel Summer".

Both "Sweet Nothings" and "Betty" are included on the "denial" list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course,<strong> Joe Alwyn isn't the only ex-boyfriend to be referenced on the "Denial" list on Apple Music</strong>.
