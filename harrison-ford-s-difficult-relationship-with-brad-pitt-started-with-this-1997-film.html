Then they offered me the part. I saved my comments about the character and the construction of the thing,” the 80-year-old star explained.</p><p>“First of all, I admire Brad. I think he’s a wonderful actor. He’s a really decent guy. But we couldn’t agree on a director until we came to Alan Pakula, who I had worked with before, but Brad had not,” Harrison added, speaking about the 1990 mystery film Presumed Innocent.</p><p>The Devil’s Own received mixed reviews from critics, although it grossed $140 million.<strong><a href=#> Brad Pitt </a></strong>even referred to the films as “the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking – if you can even call it that – that I’ve ever seen” during an interview with Newsweek.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-harrison-ford-came-up-with-his-own-script-for-the-devil-39-s-own>How Harrison Ford Came Up With His Own Script For The Devil's Own</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/aaaabboggetexj4j_q-gpd5hcyvrlbuu56qunryqrzkxl9yfydfdwo1w-j0-smbwsmjrrqeteynanai7meh_ky4f4yz6xvdgwu1kvwrm.jpg><p>In The Devil’s Own, Harrison Ford plays a New York police officer who uncovers the true identity of his house guest, an IRA assassin played by Brad Pitt. Pitt's deadly character pulls them into the crossfire of terrorism in an attempt to buy a cargo of missiles.</p><p>“Brad had this complicated character, and I wanted a complication on my side so that it wasn’t just a good-and-evil battle,” Ford explained to the outlet. “And that’s when I came up with the bad-shooting thing.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Every Harrison Ford Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the 1997 movie, Harrison Ford's character is caught in a moral quandary after witnessing his partner shoot an unarmed thief in the back. After lying to protect his partner, he chooses to resign from the NYPD.</p><p>Harrison Ford's subplot was written into the movie's final version, but working on the script whilst shooting the film was not easy. “I worked with a writer — but then all the sudden we’re shooting and we didn’t have a script that Brad and I agreed on,” The Fugitive actor explained.</p><p>“Each of us had different ideas about it. I understand why he wanted to stay with his point of view, and I wanted to stay with my point of view — or I was imposing my point of view, and it’s fair to say that that’s what Brad felt.”</p><h2 id=why-brad-pitt-slammed-the-devil-39-s-own-upon-release>Why Brad Pitt Slammed The Devil's Own Upon Release</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/devils-ow-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt spoke about the feud at the time when he gave an interview slamming the movie upon its release. "It was the hardest film I’ve ever been on," Pitt explained. "But as for reports about out-of-control egos and people hiding out in trailers, that just wasn’t the case."</p><p>Pitt, when recalling his own career, listed The Devil's Own as a role he would rather forget in his illustrious career. “We had no script. Well, we had a great script, but it got tossed for various reasons. To have to make something up as you go along … what pressure! It was ridiculous. It was the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking – if you can even call it that – that I’ve ever seen.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Brad Pitt Movie Was One Of His Worst Box Office Earners, But Critics Say It's Perfect</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harrison Ford was a much bigger fan of the movie, declaring recently "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I like the movie very much. Very much</a>." Many critics slammed the film for ignoring the history of Northern Ireland and skipping the issues involved between the two sides. Other critics were greatly unimpressed with American-born Pitt's Irish accent.</p><p>The Devil's Own is not the only Pitt film he was frustrated with. He has also spoken out about Interview with the Vampire. He explained to Rolling Stone, “I was disappointed with it. Because in the book, it was a guy trying to figure out who he was – if he’s a god or if he’s of the devil."</p><p>"The film focused more on the sensational antics of Lestat, which were done really well, but my character ended up getting dragged place to place and set up for the sensational moments. And it just became a little bit more whiny than a real search.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-pitt-admitted-making-the-devil-39-s-own-was-a-39-schooling-experience-39>Brad Pitt Admitted Making The Devil's Own Was A 'Schooling Experience'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thumb_2ebb1c51-7df1-4dbb-8735-cdc84ff5ccb7.jpg><p>The Once Upon A Time in Hollywood actor admitted that the “movie was a good schooling” despite the clashes between him and his co-star. When Brad Pitt was asked at the time if “a lot of the movie [The Devil’s Own] was made up on the fly, right?”</p><p>He responded with, “All of it, man. The [shoot took] seven months. It should have been three months."</p><p>"The experience taught me how ludicrous it could be throwing money at a problem.
