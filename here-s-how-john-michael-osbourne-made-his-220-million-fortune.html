This is because trends change and people outgrow particular trends. For this reason, it is phenomenal to see anyone have a career that spans decades in the music industry. Ozzy Osbourne, also known as the "Prince of Darkness," is a legendary musician and the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. With a career spanning over five decades, Osbourne has solidified his place as <a href=#>one of the most influential</a> and successful musicians of all time. So, how did he amass a net worth of $220 million?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Richest Man In Switzerland: Here's How Guillaume Pousaz Made His 23-Billion-Dollar Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=prince-of-darkness-ozzy-ozbourne-s-beginnings>Prince of Darkness: Ozzy Ozbourne’s&nbsp;Beginnings&nbsp;</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ozzy Osbourne was born in Marston Green, a small town located near Coleshill in England. Despite growing up in the Aston area of Birmingham, Osbourne <a href=#>had a difficult childhood</a>. He struggled with dyslexia, a learning disability that affects the ability to read, write, and spell, and was subjected to sexual abuse by school bullies.</p><p>In addition to these challenges, Osbourne also had a history of criminal activity and ended up serving time in prison for burglary. Despite facing such adversity, Osbourne was drawn to music from a young age, particularly the <a href=#>music of the Beatles</a>. He participated in school plays, such as Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado and HMS Pinafore, and had the desire to pursue a career as a rock musician.</p><p>Despite the obstacles he faced, Osbourne eventually became a successful and influential artist, known for his distinctive voice and energetic stage presence. He gained a large and devoted fan base through his powerful and emotive performances, which often included impressive feats of showmanship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Osbourne's success as a rock musician has cemented his place in the pantheon of music history, and he will always be remembered as one of the greatest and <a href=#>most influential artists</a> of his generation. Now that we are familiar with the person of Ozzy Osbourne, let us take a look at all he did to earn his fortune.</p><h2 id=ozzy-osbourne-s-successful-music-career>Ozzy Osbourne's Successful Music Career</h2><p>Ozzy Osbourne became the lead vocalist of Black Sabbath in 1969 after the band had gone through a number of different names and lineup changes. Black Sabbath played a heavy <a href=#>blues style of music</a> that was characterized by its ominous sound and lyrics, and they achieved swift and enduring success with their early albums, including Black Sabbath and Paranoid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Osbourne's time with the band was not without controversy, as he struggled with substance abuse and had conflicts with the other band members. Despite these challenges, Osbourne's distinctive voice and energetic stage presence helped to establish Black Sabbath as one of the pioneering bands of the heavy metal genre, and their music has had a lasting impact on the world of rock and roll. In 1979, Osbourne decided to leave Black Sabbath to pursue a solo career, and he has since released a number <a href=#>of successful albums</a> and toured extensively, gaining a large and devoted fan base through his powerful and emotive performances.</p><p>His contributions to music will always be remembered as some of the most influential and enduring in the history of rock and roll. Later in 2022, Ozzy collaborated with Dog Town Skates to release Ozzy Osbourne Themed skateboards.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Sergey Brin Story: How The Google Co-Founder Became A Multibillionaire</a></span></p><h2 id=ozzy-s-successful-reality-tv-career>Ozzy’s Successful Reality TV Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ozzy Osbourne became famous through his own reality TV show, "The Osbournes," <a href=#>which aired on MTV</a> from 2002 to 2005 and followed the daily lives of Ozzy and his family (wife Sharon, children Jack and Kelly, and occasional appearances from son Louis). The show was a major success and led to Ozzy and his family hosting the 30th Annual American Music Awards in 2003. Ozzy has also appeared in commercials for I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! and the online video game World of Warcraft, and he was a playable character in the music video game Guitar Hero World Tour.</p><p>In 2009, he <a href=#>published an autobiography</a> titled "I Am Ozzy," and a movie adaptation of the book is in development. A documentary film about Ozzy's life and career, "God Bless Ozzy Osbourne," premiered in 2011 and was produced by his son Jack. Ozzy and Jack also starred in a comedy reality TV show called "Ozzy & Jack's World Detour" that aired on the History Channel in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, Ozzy appeared on the UK TV show "Gogglebox" as part of<a href=#> a fundraising campaign</a> for Cancer Research UK, and he also became an ambassador for the rock-themed online casino Metal Casino.

The 21-piece line includes makeup and <a href=#>other beauty products</a> inspired by Osbourne's signature style and named after his heavy metal songs. The collection also includes candles, tattoos, a cosmetic bag, and a mirror. The products are available on the Rock and Roll Beauty and Ultra Beauty websites and in stores. This is not the first time Rock and Roll Beauty has released a range inspired by a heavy metal artist; in June, the brand launched a collection in collaboration with Def Leppard. Ozzy Osbourne also released a collection of bat-themed <a href=#>non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs) called "Cryptobatz." The collection, which includes 9,666 unique NFTs, went on sale in mid-January 2022 and was created in collaboration with a studio called Sutter Systems. The Cryptobatz NFTs will have a feature allowing them to "bite" and mutate with other NFTs, creating a mutant bat with the digital DNA of both tokens. The collection is a reference to an incident in which Osbourne bit the head off a live bat during a concert 40 years ago.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Simon Sinek Became A Best-Selling Author</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CA Knowledge</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvpq%2FOpqCnn12kx7vFjKGcq52jYrWww4yjpqGmXaK2pLTAnqNmp6OXvLa%2BzZ5kppmUmnqptdJmaWtoXaK2rbjIqKVmnp%2Bnwba6xGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-john-michael-osbourne-made-his-220-million-fortune.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20John%20Michael%20Osbourne%20Made%20His%20%24220%20Million%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-john-michael-osbourne-made-his-220-million-fortune.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-john-michael-osbourne-made-his-220-million-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20John%20Michael%20Osbourne%20Made%20His%20%24220%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-john-michael-osbourne-made-his-220-million-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20John%20Michael%20Osbourne%20Made%20His%20%24220%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-john-michael-osbourne-made-his-220-million-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20John%20Michael%20Osbourne%20Made%20His%20%24220%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-john-michael-osbourne-made-his-220-million-fortune.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20John%20Michael%20Osbourne%20Made%20His%20%24220%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-sonja-norwood-make-latest-sonja-norwood-net-worth-income-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Sonja Norwood Make?
