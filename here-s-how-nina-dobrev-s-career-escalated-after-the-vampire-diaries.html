She turned her passion into a profession when acting in television shows. Her big break occurred with the drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation when the actress joined the cast in Season 6 as Mia Jones. She portrayed the character of a high school student who later moved to Paris to pursue the dream of becoming a model. Dobrev left the show in Season 9 when a bigger opportunity was on the horizon in 2009. She bagged the role of Elena Gilbert in the CW drama <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a> that changed the trajectory of her career, and made her popular around the world.</p><p>Working alongside Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder, the trio received international recognition and took their career to new heights. Nina Dobrev has amassed an $11 million fortune through acting roles, brand endorsements, and business ventures. Let’s take a look at how Nina Dobrev’s career reached new heights since The Vampire Diaries.</p><h2 id=the-vampire-diaries-and-after>The Vampire Diaries And After</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While working on The Vampire Diaries, Nina Dobrev became an influential figure on television which led her to work in movies. While actively working on the teenage vampire drama show for six seasons until 2015 and returning for the series finale, she starred in teen-oriented drama and romance movies such as Too Young To Marry, The American Mall, and The Perks Of Being A Wallflower.</p><p>Along with sharpening her acting skills on The Vampire Diaries, Dobrev made millions starring on the show. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, she made $40,000 per episode, which equaled $880,000 per season as each season had 22 episodes. She made around $6 million starring on the show, which is more than half of her net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once she left the show after the sixth season, Nina Dobrev began experimenting with her roles rather than getting stereotyped as a teenage romance actress. She had a minor role in Chloe, an erotic thriller that was a commercial success, and tried her hand at comedy with <a href=#>the Damon Wayans Jr.</a> starrer Let’s Be Cops.</p><h2 id=bagging-awards-and-brand-endorsements>Bagging Awards And Brand Endorsements</h2><p>Her hard work on The Vampire Diaries and movie projects paid off as she won many accolades for her stellar performances. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, she won the Young Hollywood Award in 2014 for the show. She has won Choice TV Actress a whopping five times at the Teen Choice Awards and three times at the People’s Choice Awards. She also won an ensemble award and the cast at the San Diego Film Critics Society Awards for her supporting role in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing with her pursuit to work in action movies, Dobrev had a supporting role in Mark Wahlberg’s Patriots Day and played the lead in box-office smashing hit and highly-anticipated installment XXX: Return of Xander Cage in 2017 opposite Vin Diesel. She returned to television with the CBS sitcom Fam in 2019, which ran for one season.</p><p>There is no better way to stay in the public eye than to endorse iconic brands. Dobrev had already been the brand ambassador of <a href=#>Dior Beauty for years</a>, but in March 2021, she became Maison Christian Dior’s U.S Fragrance Ambassador, as stated by <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. She has partnered with the brand to celebrate the heritage of Dior fragrances while promoting the brand’s skincare and make-up products.</p><h2 id=venturing-into-the-business-world>Venturing Into The Business World</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As celebrities have begun entering the world of business through the Spirit Drinks category in recent years, Nina Dobrev took that as an opportunity to launch her wine label with her <a href=#>best friend and actress Julianne Hough</a>. They co-own Fresh Vine Wine, a brand that manufactures lower-calorie, lower-carb wines for health-conscious customers. Their wines are produced in Napa Valley, California. They launched the wine company in 2019 and have already received a positive response from the public.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Sofia Vergara Grew Her Multi-Million-Dollar Businesses</a></span></p><p>After observing a rapid demand in customers, the company has offered five selections of wine, with a minimum price of $15. In December 2021, Nina Dobrev and her business partner listed their company on the New York Stock Exchange, raised $33 million from the initial public offering, and closed the market by ringing the closing bell, as stated by <a href=#>Variety</a>. The actress has mentioned plans of launching Cabernet wine through her company in the coming months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nina Dobrev began her career as a supporting actor on a TV show and became a lead on The Vampire Diaries, a show that has garnered a fandom for years to come. While actively working as an actress, she became the face of an iconic fashion house and managed to launch and maintain a successful business in a competitive category. With years to come, Nina Dobrev will have big plans to make a mark in Hollywood. More recently, she was seen starring in the 2021 Christmas romantic comedy, Love Hard opposite Jimmy O. Yang and Darren Barnet.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Billionaire's Collection: 15 Cars In Mukesh Ambani's $20 Million Garage</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=#>Variety</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6diu6q6wGabqJqimsO0ecKaqZ6domKytK%2FApZitnZRirqfAxKtkraCVYsOiuc%2BiqZ5llJ6us7XErGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-nina-dobrev-s-career-escalated-after-the-vampire-diaries.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Nina%20Dobrev%27s%20Career%20Escalated%20After%20The%20Vampire%20Diaries&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-nina-dobrev-s-career-escalated-after-the-vampire-diaries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-nina-dobrev-s-career-escalated-after-the-vampire-diaries.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Nina%20Dobrev%27s%20Career%20Escalated%20After%20The%20Vampire%20Diaries" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-nina-dobrev-s-career-escalated-after-the-vampire-diaries.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Nina%20Dobrev%27s%20Career%20Escalated%20After%20The%20Vampire%20Diaries" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-nina-dobrev-s-career-escalated-after-the-vampire-diaries.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Nina%20Dobrev%27s%20Career%20Escalated%20After%20The%20Vampire%20Diaries" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-nina-dobrev-s-career-escalated-after-the-vampire-diaries.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Nina%20Dobrev%27s%20Career%20Escalated%20After%20The%20Vampire%20Diaries" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jenna-dewan-tatum-naked-in-ocean-for-allure-s-nudes-issue-picture.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenna Dewan Tatum Naked in Ocean for Allure's &amp;quot;Nudes&amp;quot; Issue: Picture">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./daniel-toce-who-is-kim-biermann-s-first-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daniel Toce: Who is Kim Biermanns first husband?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
