Fans were <a href=#>excited to see Derek return in season 17</a>, and it was definitely amazing seeing Meredith talk to him again on the beach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Fans want Arizona to come back</a>, and it'll be interesting to see what the next season is like. Let's take a look at everything we know about season 18, which will premiere on September 30th, 2021.</p><h2 id=addison-montgomery-and-ellis-grey>Addison Montgomery And Ellis Grey</h2><p><a href=#>Fans are excited that Kate Walsh is returning</a> as her popular Grey's Anatomy character Addison Montgomery.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Walsh told TV Line in 2017</a> said that it felt like her character was done on the show and said, “I feel like we wrapped it up. I’m not saying if [series creator] Shonda [Rhimes] was like, ‘We’re gonna do a very special episode of Grey’s where… ‘ But she really consciously, we did it all. We had the spinoff, and we had all that. It was an amazing experience and journey.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans who have watched Addison's amazing character arc on Private Private, the spin-off that the actress was referring to, know that she has been through so much since leaving Grey's Anatomy. Addison joined the other doctors at Oceanside Wellness in California and had an on-again, off-again relationship with Sam Bennett, her good friend Naomi's ex-husband. While it seemed like they would always be together, they broke up and by the end of the series, Addison had chosen Jake Reilly and they were raising baby Henry.</p><p>The drama between Meredith and Addison was always about Addison's ex-husband Derek Shepherd, of course, and now that Derek is gone, perhaps they can see eye to eye again. It'll be fascinating to see what happens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellis Grey will also come back</a>: according to Us Weekly, the trailer sees Ellis Grey asking Meredith, “You survived the unthinkable, what are you going to do Meredith?" According to Deadline.com, Kate Burton will come back for several episodes and she will be in the season 18 premiere.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest 'Grey's Anatomy' Star In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=quot-here-comes-the-sun-quot>"Here Comes The Sun"</h2><p>According to Us Weekly, the first episode of season 18 will be called "Here Comes The Sun" and someone will come into the hospital after being injured by fireworks. It's also worth noting that the premiere episode will be a crossover with Station 19.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The official description of the season premiere from ABC says, “As the city of Seattle revels at the Phoenix Fair celebrating the city’s rebirth post-COVID, the Grey Sloan doctors treat a patient who encounters illegal fireworks. “Meanwhile, Bailey has her sights set on hiring new doctors, but she’s having trouble finding viable options. Owen and Teddy attempt to take the next step in their engagement, and Meredith has a surprising opportunity when she meets a dynamic doctor from her mother‘s past.”</p><p>This all sounds amazing, as there is a lot of drama happening. Fans love Miranda Bailey and it'll be hilarious watching her set high standards for the doctors that she wants to hire. Meredith's storyline also sounds really intriguing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Stars Katherine Heigl And T.R.

He asked her for a drink, and then he found her outside having collapsed from COVID.” Meg Marinis continued, “we saw Hayes being more drawn to her even as she was in a hospital bed all season."</p><p>In other exciting news, Peter Gallagher will star on the show as Dr. Alan Hamilton. According to TV Insider, he will be in the season 18 premiere and Meredtih will interact with him, as he and Ellis Grey knew each other. This is great news for any fans of The O.C. who love following the actor's career in the years since the teen drama was airing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 'Grey's Anatomy': What Do Fans Think About Meredith And DeLuca's 20 Year Age Difference?</a></span></p><p>No matter what happens in season 18 of Grey's Anatomy, fans do hope that Meredith Grey has a much easier and smoother time as she really was put through the ringer in season 17. And if she can reconnect with some people from her past and also find love again, viewers will be really pleased.
