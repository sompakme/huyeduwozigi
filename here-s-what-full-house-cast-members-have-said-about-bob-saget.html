(Gen Zs, America's Funniest Home Videos was like if YouTube were only on for half an hour every day... and Bob Saget hosted it.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bob Saget Died Of Natural Causes: Police Report</a></span></p><p>His death has affected so many fans who felt like they really knew him, in part because of how genuine he was in life and in his portrayal of the sitcom dad. Others in Hollywood have long spoken highly of him and the most consistent thread is without a doubt his kindness; nearly everyone who has ever worked with him, it seems, has chimed in on his kind and compassionate heart and how quick he was to tell those around him that he loved them. Bob Saget left a lot of mourners, and his Full House cast mates are certainly some of the most notable. Here's what his Full House costars have said about his death.</p><h2 id=john-stamos-39-i-39-m-not-ready-to-accept-that-he-39-s-gone-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>John Stamos: 'I'm Not Ready To Accept That He's Gone'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John Stamos, AKA the ultra slick Uncle Jesse, was clearly gutted. He has posted several pictures now on his Instagram account as tribute to <a href=#>his late friend</a> and his grief is palpable. "I'm not ready to accept that he's gone," he wrote. "I'm not going to say goodbye yet. I'm going to imagine him out there, still on the road, doing what he loves with all his heart and humor. He's standing on stage, killing! Another two-hour set in front of a couple hundred of the luckiest people on the planet. They're laughing so hard, they weep."</p><h2 id=andrea-barber-39-he-had-the-biggest-heart-of-anyone-in-hollywood-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Andrea Barber: 'He Had The Biggest Heart Of Anyone In Hollywood'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andrea Barber, better known as DJ's best friend Kimmy Gibbler, posted on Instagram: "This one hurts. He had the biggest heart of anyone in Hollywood. He gave the biggest hugs. I am gutted that I will never be able to hug him again. Bob ended every text, every interaction with 'Love you.' Didnâ€™t matter how long or short weâ€™d been apart. He loved so deeply and so fiercely. And he never hesitated to tell you just how much you meant to him. This is the greatest lesson I learned from Bob Saget â€“ don't hesitate to tell people you love them. I feel at peace knowing that Bob knew exactly how much I adore him. Rest well, my dear friend. I have no doubt you are making everyone in Heaven laugh until their cheeks hurt, just as you did here on Earth."</p><h2 id=mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen-39-he-will-continue-to-be-by-our-side-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mary Kate And Ashley Olsen: 'He Will Continue To Be By Our Side'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen were barely toddlers during the Full House days, you might think they wouldn't remember very much about shooting the show or about their fellow cast members. But a legend like Bob Saget was bound to make a lasting impression; the now-adult twins said in a joint statement: "Bob was the most loving, compassionate, and generous man. We are deeply saddened that he is no longer with us but know that he will continue to be by our side to guide us as gracefully as he always has. We are thinking of his daughters, wife, and family and are sending our condolences."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Bob Saget Really Thinks Of His TV Daughters From 'Full House'</a></span></p><h2 id=dave-coulier-39-i-39-ll-never-let-go-brother-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dave Coulier: 'I'll Never Let Go, Brother'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one of the most tear-jerking tributes, Dave Coulier, who played Uncle Joey to Bob Saget's Danny Tanner on Full House, wrote on Instagram: "I met Bob when I was 18 years old. I didn't know then that two struggling standup comics would end up being brothers forever. I wish I could lean on you right now through all these tears. I love you." If that doesn't make you well up, how about the comment <a href=#>Bob Saget's wife Kelly Rizzo</a> wrote on Dave's picture? She said, "Dave. Bob said CONSTANTLY, 'No one in my life makes me laugh harder than Dave.' He must've told me 10 Dave stories everyday [sic] for 6 years. Cannot wait to hug you. I love you."</p><h2 id=jodie-sweetin-39-you-were-supposed-to-be-here-longer-hellip-how-rude-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jodie Sweetin: 'You Were Supposed To Be Here Longerâ€¦How Rude.'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jodie Sweetin borrowed some words from her Full House character Stephanie to top off her emotional Instagram tribute to Bob Saget. She wrote, "There arenâ€™t enough words to express what Iâ€™m feeling today. Nor are they big enough to capture even a slice of who he was. One thing I do know, is that we never missed a chance to tell each other, 'I love you'. Every time we talked, there were at least 3 or 4 exchanged at the end of a conversation, whether it was text, phone call or in person." After sharing some of her favorite memories of the man she called "the best TV dad ever," she concluded: "You were supposed to be here longer...how rude."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Bob Saget Go On 'The Masked Singer'?</a></span></p><h2 id=lori-laughlin-39-words-cannot-begin-to-express-how-devastated-i-am-39><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lori Laughlin: 'Words Cannot Begin To Express How Devastated I Am'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a statement to Us Magazine, Bob Saget's castmate and friend Lori Laughlin, who played Aunt Becky, said, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Words cannot begin to express how devastated I am</a>.
