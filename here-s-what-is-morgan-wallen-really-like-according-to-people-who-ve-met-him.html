After using derogatory language, his label dropped him, and venues that booked him no longer wanted the Thought You Should Know singer to perform, <a href=#>which could have cost Wallen everything monetarily</a>. But instead of losing fans and country stars turning their backs on Wallen, they rallied around him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those who knew Wallen said he was only using a term he had heard used in rap music in conversation versus trying to be rude. They went on to claim that the Whiskey Glasses singer was a good person and got a bad rap from the media when the video that caught Wallen saying the derogatory phrase went viral.</p><p>To get a true idea of who Wallen is, it is necessary to go directly to the source of those who know him. Then and only then, will his true personality be revealed. Here is what Morgan Wallen is really like, according to people who have met him.</p><h2 id=morgan-wallen-apparently-has-a-big-heart>Morgan Wallen Apparently Has A Big Heart</h2><p>While Wallen has had some questionable behavior over the course of his short career, many fans swear by the fact that the Voice alum likes to give back among the <a href=#>things he has done since leaving the reality show</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Everything I Love singer got wind that there was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">young fan battling leukemia whose only wish was to see him in concert</a>. Not only did Wallen provide tickets to the little girl named Gracie, but he also flew her to his concert and spent time with her before he went on stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screen-shot-2019-08-28-at-11-56-46-pm.png><p>Another fan named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brevin was inspired by the fact that Wallen admitted he was wrong when he used a derogatory term</a> in 2021. He, too, was dealing with some things in his life but was doing his best to stay strong at 12 years of age.</p><p>As such, Brevin's mother had one request and that was if Wallen could simply write a letter that just said "good job" to keep Brevin encouraged. But Wallen went above and beyond that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did the Sand In My Boots singer write a letter, but he put together some swag from his shows and shipped it off to Brevin.

And the reason they do so is that Wallen is the first to admit when he has done something wrong and do what he can to make it right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Wallen was booked to appear on Saturday Night Live <a href=#>when the show was back in rare form</a>. But, that gig was taken away when it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallen did not follow COVID protocols</a>. He reportedly chose to drink and hang out with co-eds in close quarters instead. And after he learned the news that his actions caused him a huge exposure opportunity, Wallen took to social media to address it.</p><p>"I’d like to apologize to SNL, to my fans, to my team for bringing me these opportunities, and I Iet them down," Wallen stated. "And, on a more personal note, I think I have some growing up to do. You know, I think I’ve lost myself a little bit."</p><p>This statement was met with responses from country stars supporting Wallen, letting the You Proof singer that everyone makes mistakes.</p><p>"Don’t beat yourself up pal, God is still working on ya," Jake Owen said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Morgan Wallen Amassed His $4 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Ernest wrote, "Love u bro. Proud of u."</p><p>"You are precious!!!," Schlapman said. "Your humility is astounding. We love you!!"</p><p>When the derogatory term was used by Wallen, some of his biggest supporters were from the African American community. And after an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explanation stating the manner in which Wallen used the phrase was not meant to be racist</a> from superstars who knew Wallen personally, Wallen was able to survive his scandal and become even more successful in the process.</p><p>"He didn’t use the -er," Allen said. "So that’s why a lot of black people, we laughed at it. It was like, ‘Oh ok, well he said it right.’ True, you shouldn’t say it, but at the same time, just because I don’t agree with what he said doesn’t mean I should banish him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Morgan Wallen's Girlfriend Paige After They Broke Up?</a></span></p><p>Brown also came to Wallen's support, saying, "... I personally know Morgan. I texted him that day. I told him he shouldn’t have said it, but also knowing Morgan, I knew that he didn’t mean it in the way that the world thought that he meant it."</p><p>Others still have nothing but the nicest of words to say about how professional Wallen is to work with and how genuine he is. All things that point to Wallen being a good person.</p><h2 id=fans-say-alcohol-brings-out-the-bad-side-of-morgan-wallen>Fans Say Alcohol Brings Out The Bad Side Of Morgan Wallen</h2><p>Many artists have a vice. For Wallen, it appears it is alcohol. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">And it is when he has consumed too much that Wallen becomes a person no one recognizes</a>.</p><p>"Friend said at the end of the show when they were back in the green room Morgan was there, wasted," one Reddit user said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Spitting his dip directly onto the floor while asking strangers to let him hit their vape.

When he is not heavily drinking, and <a href=#>abstaining from alcohol like some celebrities</a>, many have commented on how kind-hearted and hardworking he is. But allegedly, when alcohol enters the picture, Wallen becomes a different person. And that person is someone not many want to be around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecyoqaCZnmLEorjLnqVmqpWWua3FjKWgpJ1f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-what-is-morgan-wallen-really-like-according-to-people-who-ve-met-him.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20Is%20Morgan%20Wallen%20Really%20Like%2c%20According%20To%20People%20Who%27ve%20Met%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-what-is-morgan-wallen-really-like-according-to-people-who-ve-met-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-is-morgan-wallen-really-like-according-to-people-who-ve-met-him.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Is%20Morgan%20Wallen%20Really%20Like%2c%20According%20To%20People%20Who%27ve%20Met%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-what-is-morgan-wallen-really-like-according-to-people-who-ve-met-him.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Is%20Morgan%20Wallen%20Really%20Like%2c%20According%20To%20People%20Who%27ve%20Met%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-what-is-morgan-wallen-really-like-according-to-people-who-ve-met-him.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Is%20Morgan%20Wallen%20Really%20Like%2c%20According%20To%20People%20Who%27ve%20Met%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-what-is-morgan-wallen-really-like-according-to-people-who-ve-met-him.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20Is%20Morgan%20Wallen%20Really%20Like%2c%20According%20To%20People%20Who%27ve%20Met%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./het-thakkar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Het Thakkar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./before-wooing-his-now-wife-will-smith-was-rejected-by-fresh-prince-co-star-karyn-parsons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Before Wooing His Now-Wife, Will Smith Was Rejected By Fresh Prince Co-Star Karyn Parsons">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
