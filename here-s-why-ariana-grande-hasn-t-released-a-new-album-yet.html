From Yours Truly to Positions, all her albums have topped the music charts and have won Grammys and Brits.While the majority of the artists were releasing albums during the Coronavirus pandemic, Ariana Grande did not release anything apart from her collaboration with Justin Bieber with their song, "Stuck With U."Although she did want Positions to be released earlier, Grande revealed that the beginning of 2020 was not the best time to drop an album. Instead, decided to <a href=#>take a break from releasing music</a> and spend time with her family and now-husband Dalton.Since her beginnings at Nickelodeon, the actress has become one of the most popular and most loved singers of today. As her last album was released in October 2020, there is a lot of anticipation for the singer's comeback.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>From 'Thank U, Next' To 'Dangerous Woman': Ariana Grande's Biggest Moments In Music History</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ag7-for-2021-was-off-the-table>AG7 For 2021 Was 'Off The Table'</h2><p>Weeks after Positions was released, fans wondered what the next album would sound like. A Twitter account from a supposed 'Arianator' started the rumor that the singer was in the works to drop a new album in early 2021.</p><p>The now-deleted tweet went viral and fans seemed to believe that the news was true. Ariana has released her albums within months of each other, so it would not be a surprise if she did. However, Ariana addressed the rumor and denied it.</p><p>Nonetheless, the artist had released a deluxe version of Positions with five additional tracks: "test drive", "worst behavior", "main thing" as well as a remix of "34+35" and an interlude titled "someone like u" where fans thought of the song being dedicated to her husband, Dalton Gomez.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her sixth studio album 'Positions' became Grande's fifth album to hit number one in the Billboard charts. Even though she did not release any more of her music throughout the year of 2021, she collaborated with different artists such as Kid Cudi with their song 'Just Look Up' for the movie Don't Look Up, in which she was also cast, and Kelly Clarkson for her ninth-studio album with a song titled 'Santa, Can’t You Hear Me.'</p><p><span class=next-single><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Gloria Estefan Inspired Ariana Grande To Go After Music</a></span></span></p><h2 id=don-t-look-up-and-other-projects>"Don't Look Up" And Other Projects</h2><p>One of the reasons why Ariana might have not released an album is because the entire filming process for the Don't Look Up film took almost a year, and also she participated as a coach for the 21st season of The Voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ariana made her return to the acting industry by participating in the movie Don't Look Up, which had <a href=#>one of the most expensive casts</a> in it. Big names like Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Timothée Chalamet, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jonah Hill. She did not have much screen time, but she did demonstrate that she is more than a funny character from Nickelodeon.</p><p>Although she has not acted for a long time, the fact that the character of Riley Bina was an international music star, <a href=#>was the perfect opportunity for the singe</a>r. As she had dropped Positions in October 2020, it was the perfect timing for Ariana to be completely focused on the role.</p><p>The Dangerous Woman has also been busy focusing on her new business. That was the launch of <a href=#>her own makeup brand inspired by her song titled R.E.M</a>, which stands for "dream beauty."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She is not the first singer to come up with a cosmetic line. Popstar Selena Gomez also has her cosmetics and skincare line, "Rare Beauty," and the name comes from her album, also titled Rare.</p><p>Not to forget, she became Mrs. Gomez after she had married Dalton Gomez, a real estate agent from Los Angeles in May 2021.
