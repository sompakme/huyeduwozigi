The Pitch Perfect series also introduced us to stars such as Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Ben Platt, Skylar Astin and Adam Devine, and made acapella music <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cool again.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Pitch Perfect 3 was released in 2017, the film’s stars have consistently made appearances on each other’s social media profiles, have had high profile reunions, and have been present for each other’s important milestones. Though we know co-stars don’t always <a href=#>get along on set,</a> it seems like the Pitch Perfect gals have remained friends through the years. Let’s take a look at how close the Barden Bellas (and their acapella friends) are today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of 'Pitch Perfect' Has Been Up To Since The Third Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=the-bellas-bonded-during-filming><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Bellas Bonded During Filming</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on descriptions of their time on set, it seems it was love at first sight for the Pitch Perfect cast. It’s hard to fake the chemistry that the Barden Bellas had, and Anna Kendrick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to Hello Giggles</a> that the cast hung out all the time during filming. “We spend every waking moment together: We’re shooting together constantly, we’re in the hair and makeup trailer together and when we’re not shooting, we’re in a green room together. It starts to feel like ‘Oh, my God if I see these girls for one more second…’ and then every weekend it’s just like, ‘What you guys up to?,” Kendrick revealed. Co-star Hana Mae Lee agreed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confessing</a> that the cast went to football games, dinner, and even New Orleans together regularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brittany Snow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">echoed </a>her co-stars’ sentiments, and described how she instantly clicked with co-star Anna Camp, revealing “I actually asked Anna Camp (Aubrey) out on a girlfriend date the first day that we were there because we were playing best friends. I knew it was important for us to bond. I was really hoping that I liked her, and I asked her out to dinner. Within 10 minutes, I realised that we were going to be really good friends. And then it kind of became very odd how much we were hitting it off. We have the exact same sense of humour.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</a></span></p><h2 id=they-have-done-other-movies-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Have Done Other Movies Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s pretty clear that the Pitch Perfect cast can’t get enough of each other in their personal lives - and it turns out, they’ve kept their professional relationships strong too! Anna Kendrick, Elizabeth Banks, and Rebel Wilson have done 4 movies together - the Pitch Perfect series, and the 2012 film What To Expect When You’re Expecting. Though Kendrick didn’t share any scenes with her Pitch Perfect co-stars, Wilson hilariously played the eccentric assistant to Banks’ shop owner character.</p><p>Rebel Wilson also took advantage of her chemistry with Pitch Perfect love interest Adam Devine in the 2019 romantic comedy Isn’t It Romantic. When discussing their friendship, Devine <a href=#>revealed </a>"We're very comfortable with each other. I’m hoping me and her just keep going down this path where once a year, we have a weird project together until we’re old people. It’s sort of a Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder situation where we just star in a 100 movies together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besties Anna Camp and Brittany Snow have also worked together, with Camp <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starring in Snow’s directorial debut Milkshake.</a> “Camp is one of my best friends. I thought it was really important to choose someone I know and could really embody such a complex character, because her actions are, seemingly on the surface, misdirected and terrible, but really it is coming from a place of yearning for a connection and wanting her daughter to succeed. Striking that balance of love and hate is difficult, but I knew Camp could do it,” Snow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> about the casting process.</p><h2 id=they-rsquo-ve-attended-each-other-rsquo-s-weddings-and-bachelorette-parties><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They’ve Attended Each Other’s Weddings (And Bachelorette Parties)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Friendship wasn’t the only thing blossoming on the Pitch Perfect set - it was also the site of a romance between Anna Camp and Skylar Astin. The two were engaged in 2014, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got married in 2016</a>, in front of Pitch Perfect stars Brittany Snow, Elizabeth Banks and Rebel Wilson. Sadly, Camp and Astin were not a forever Pitch Perfect love story - the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> couple divorced in 2019.</a></p><p>Though Brittany Snow didn’t meet her now-husband on the Pitch Perfect set, her co-stars were also involved in her wedding festivities. Snow and her husband, filmmaker Tyler Stanaland, got married in March 2020. Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp and Chrissie Fit attended her <a href=#>bachelorette party</a>, and Anna Camp and Chrissie Fit were even part of Snow’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bridal party.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Quotes Pitch Perfect Actors Said In Interviews About The Movies</a></span></p><h2 id=the-barden-bellas-reunited-during-the-pandemic><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Barden Bellas Reunited During The Pandemic</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the COVID pandemic, the Barden Bellas got back together to sing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Love on Top”,</a> a <strong><a href=#>Beyonce </a></strong>classic, for a good cause - the song raised money for UNICEF and children who were disadvantaged during the pandemic. Though the reunion was virtual, it was clear the cast wished they were performing together.

It was the most social media activity we had seen from the Pitch Perfect buds in a while, with Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, and Chrissie Fit and Wilson herself posting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple Instagram photos</a> of their time in the sun.
