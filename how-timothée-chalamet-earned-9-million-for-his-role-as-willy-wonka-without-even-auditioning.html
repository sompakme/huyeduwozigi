He has worked in films like, Call Me By Your Name, The King, Dune, and LadyBird. Before Chalamet landed these roles, he went to LaGuardia high school for Music and Art, where he began to nurture his talent in acting.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Kylie Jenner Will Never Let Timothée Chalamet Meet Her Kids</a></span></p><p>The Little Women star landed his first significant movie role when he appeared in Interstellar as Tom, but his role as Elio in Call Me By Your Name alongside Armie Harmer made him the movie star to watch when it was released in 2017. However, some fans think Chalamet landed these roles because of his connections in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was labeled a ‘Nepo baby’ by an exposé in New York Magazine, revealing that his uncle, Rodman Flender, was a Hollywood director known for projects like Leprechaun 2. But there was no evidence that he assisted his nephew in becoming as successful as he is in Tinsel town; that might be all thanks to his good looks.</p><h2 id=timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-hasn-rsquo-t-auditioned-for-a-movie-role-in-years>Timothée Chalamet Hasn’t Auditioned For A Movie Role In Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52049459-1.jpg><p>There’s no denying Timothée Chalamet has stolen everyone’s hearts with his stellar performances over the years. So much so that he doesn’t have to audition for some of the most coveted roles; he’s just offered them directly by directors. All this came out when reports began spreading that Chalamet had lost out on playing the lead role for Gladiator 2. But his agent, Brian Swardstorm, came out to clear the air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swardstorm revealed on Twitter that his client never auditioned for the role since he didn't have time. They said their client had been filming Dune in the Middle East for months and “hasn’t auditioned for anything in more than 7 years.” He wanted to maintain Chalamet’s reputation, but his statement didn’t sit well with his fans.</p><p>Most of them were convinced he didn’t have to audition because he enjoyed certain privileges because of his looks. One Twitter user explained further, “the fact that black & brown actors with 20+ years careers are still auditioning, but he doesn’t have to bc <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is the “it guy” should be brought up in the white privilege discussion</a> because he has yet to reach a “every movie I’ve been the lead, has made profits” status.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Fan Got To Experience Three-Hours On A Plane Sitting Next To Timothee Chalamet In Coach, And The Actor Raved About A Particular Show</a></span></p><p>Fans insist he deserves the level he’s gotten to where he doesn’t have to audition as one of the most recognizable faces today. Most recently, 2021’s Dune, which he starred in, did well at the box office, earning over $400 million with a $165 million budget. So its makes sense why every director wants Chalamet in their movies.</p><h2 id=how-timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-landed-the-willy-wonka-role>How Timothée Chalamet Landed The Willy Wonka Role</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Timothée-Chalamet-As-Willy-Wonka.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the outrage from some fans, it hasn’t stopped the American-French actor from landing more high-profile roles. The last film Chalamet auditioned for was Director Scott Cooper’s 2017 film, Hostiles, and it was only because he had never seen any of the actor’s work before. He was the only one who had to audition since the other roles had already been written specifically for actors like Christian Bale, Adam Beach, and Q'orianka Kilcher.</p><p>Cooper said after working with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chalamet he had a bright future ahead</a> of him. "Timmy, whose work I had never seen—he’s a very uninhibited actor. He’s not afraid to take risks, clearly, as you can see from “Call Me by Your Name.”</p><p>Since then, Chalamet has been offered several roles, including one to play Willy Wonka in the upcoming prequel, Wonka, for no less than $9 million, according to Variety. Wonka director Paul King admitted he had only seen Chalamet’s viral video performance in high school and decided to hire him. Other actors who had allegedly been considered for the role included Donald Glover, Ezra Miller, and Ryan Gosling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film, a prequel to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder, is set to release at the end of the year. From the Wonka trailer, the film will follow a young Willy Wonka who arrives in an uptight European centre full of chocolate shops with a dream to make the best chocolate in the world. The movie, described as a colorful musical "with several huge numbers," will be the first for Chalamet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>King told Rolling Stone, Chalamet didn’t have to audition for the role because he was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">only actor in his mind who could do it.</a> “I knew from stanning for Timmy Chalamet that he could sing and dance really well. And I knew that was in his arsenal, but I didn’t know how good he was.” In another interview with People, he said Chalamet’s dancing and singing skills would be featured heavily throughout the movie and would surprise many fans.</p><p>"He was rehearsing for months before we went to kind of that honing skills, which was a pleasure to watch.” The Paddington director continued to heap praises on Chalamet’s performance as Willy Wonka, adding, “Just like the Willy Wonka that people will know — but also, he brings such heart to the role, and he's a brilliant actor,"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroqWfqbWmecKhmKWZnZrBbsPIpaOyZaeku6ytjKyYpZmirnqiwcOiq6Knnqh8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-earned-9-million-for-his-role-as-willy-wonka-without-even-auditioning.html&text=How%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Earned%20%249%20Million%20For%20His%20Role%20As%20Willy%20Wonka%20Without%20Even%20Auditioning&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-earned-9-million-for-his-role-as-willy-wonka-without-even-auditioning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-earned-9-million-for-his-role-as-willy-wonka-without-even-auditioning.html&title=How%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Earned%20%249%20Million%20For%20His%20Role%20As%20Willy%20Wonka%20Without%20Even%20Auditioning" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-earned-9-million-for-his-role-as-willy-wonka-without-even-auditioning.html&title=How%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Earned%20%249%20Million%20For%20His%20Role%20As%20Willy%20Wonka%20Without%20Even%20Auditioning" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-earned-9-million-for-his-role-as-willy-wonka-without-even-auditioning.html&title=How%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Earned%20%249%20Million%20For%20His%20Role%20As%20Willy%20Wonka%20Without%20Even%20Auditioning" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-timoth%25C3%25A9e-chalamet-earned-9-million-for-his-role-as-willy-wonka-without-even-auditioning.html&description=How%20Timothe%20Chalamet%20Earned%20%249%20Million%20For%20His%20Role%20As%20Willy%20Wonka%20Without%20Even%20Auditioning" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jojo-splatt-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="JoJo Splatt Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-close-are-the-pitch-perfect-girls-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Close Are The 'Pitch Perfect' Girls Today?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
