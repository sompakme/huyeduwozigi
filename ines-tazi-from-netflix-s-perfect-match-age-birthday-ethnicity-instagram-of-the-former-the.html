French by nationality, the 25-year-old star is of mixed ethnicity as her father is a Moroccan Muslim, and her mother is a French Catholic. Follow to know more about Inez with her Instagram handle (@taziines).&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Perfect Match</strong> on <strong>Netflix</strong> features 23 singles from various reality shows such as Love Is Blind, The Mole, The Circle, and others. The singles will be tasked with forming relationships and competing in challenges to determine which couple will be crowned a matchmaking pair. And the matchmaking couple will be able to welcome new singles to break up other couples or to date for themselves.</p><p>Netflix customers are eager to learn more about singles including <strong>Ines Tazi. </strong>The French beauty first appeared on reality television with The Circle: France. Despite having an interesting time on the show, she is ready to meet her special someone.</p><p>After seeing her on a previous game show, people are excited to see what Ines will do this time. She seems sincere about finding love here, and we can’t wait to see what else the show has in store for her. But, in the meantime, here are all the details you need to know about Ines in order to better understand her and predict what decisions she will make in the show.</p><p>Additionally, know about <strong>Anne-Sophie</strong>, <strong>Kariselle Snow</strong>, <strong>Joey Sasso</strong>, and <strong>Savannah Palacio</strong>.</p><h2>Ines Tazi From Netflix’s Perfect Match: French by Nationality, the 25-Year-Old Star Is of Mixed Ethnicity and Celebrates Her Birthday on August 17!</h2><p><strong>Ines Tazi</strong> (@taziines) is one of the contestants in Perfect Match, who made a name for herself by lying about herself. She currently lives in London but holds French nationality because she was born in Paris, in 1997. Likely, the 25-year-old star celebrates her birthday on the 17th of August every year.</p><p>Meanwhile, she comes from a diverse family who has mixed ethnicity. Her parents are from different continents and have different cultures and religions. Her father is Muslim and from Morocco. Similarly, Ines’ mother is a French Catholic.</p><p>The Parisian beauty was last seen in season 1 of The Circle France, a show she appeared in while in a relationship and pretending to be single. According to reports, Ines moved to London in 2014, but she cannot be confined to one location. Her job requires her to travel between Los Angeles, Morocco, and Paris. In her first year at SOAS University of London, she chose the ICC Foundation Program, World History, and Development Studies.</p><p>In Development Studies, Ines received a 2.1 and merit. The following year, she concentrated on Social Science, specifically the political economy of liberalism, and in her final year, she wrote a dissertation on the Financialization of Nonfinancial Corporations. She began the course in 2014 and graduated in 2015 with an upper second 2.1 grade while also teaching boxing at the SOAS Boxing Society.</p><p>She began working in 2016 while continuing her education. Her first known internship was as a Marketing analyst in the commercial and logistics department at Marwa in Casablanca, Morocco. She took a one-year break after her four-month internship from June to September 2016. She returned to work as an Assistant General Manager at Olan Partners for two months in July 2017. From 2017 to 2018, she worked as a Part-Time Social Media Manager at Pantone Creative. All of her efforts paid off when she was named an associate founder of Skult, a personal care product manufacturing company based in London that launched in September 2018.</p><p>We are aware that she is currently single and not in a relationship because she is on Perfect Match. While catfishing on The Circle France, she did admit to being in a relationship. However, no other information about her beau was revealed at the time. She has, however, shared a few photos with <strong>Joseph Arber</strong>, a data scientist and analyst from the United Kingdom. When a commenter inquired if he was her bae, Ines confirmed that the two were indeed dating.</p><p>The photos were taken with him between July 2019 and February 2020, but they no longer follow each other on Instagram. As a result, it is safe to assume that the two have parted ways. Given the timeline of their relationship and The Circle France, Joseph could be the man she was dating at the time of the show. Following that, there are no updates on her dating life.</p><p>As a result, it appears that Ines has decided to keep it private. It won’t last long, though, because, after Netflix Perfect Match, fans will be curious to know who she is dating from the show and her relationship status at all times. We wish the young and ambitious woman all the best, regardless of who she ends up with.</p><p>Before leaving, find out <strong>if Dom and Francesca are still together</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGemsBuwMCzoGaeoqS6brrErZ2loaioerGx0Z%2BcnKxdoq61r8dmmKCdXZe2s8DHnZiyZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmWZo8C1rcarmKZln5t6tbTEZp2oqp2av27Ax55knKGimLmmedKtmKtn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fines-tazi-from-netflix-s-perfect-match-age-birthday-ethnicity-instagram-of-the-former-the.html&text=Ines%20Tazi%20From%20Netflixs%20Perfect%20Match%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Ethnicity%20%26amp%3b%20Instagram%20of%20the%20Former%20The%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fines-tazi-from-netflix-s-perfect-match-age-birthday-ethnicity-instagram-of-the-former-the.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fines-tazi-from-netflix-s-perfect-match-age-birthday-ethnicity-instagram-of-the-former-the.html&title=Ines%20Tazi%20From%20Netflixs%20Perfect%20Match%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Ethnicity%20%26amp%3b%20Instagram%20of%20the%20Former%20The%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fines-tazi-from-netflix-s-perfect-match-age-birthday-ethnicity-instagram-of-the-former-the.html&title=Ines%20Tazi%20From%20Netflixs%20Perfect%20Match%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Ethnicity%20%26amp%3b%20Instagram%20of%20the%20Former%20The%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fines-tazi-from-netflix-s-perfect-match-age-birthday-ethnicity-instagram-of-the-former-the.html&title=Ines%20Tazi%20From%20Netflixs%20Perfect%20Match%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Ethnicity%20%26amp%3b%20Instagram%20of%20the%20Former%20The%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fines-tazi-from-netflix-s-perfect-match-age-birthday-ethnicity-instagram-of-the-former-the.html&description=Ines%20Tazi%20From%20Netflixs%20Perfect%20Match%3a%20Age%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Ethnicity%20%26amp%3b%20Instagram%20of%20the%20Former%20The%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-illymation-bi-real-face-reveal-and-boyfriend-details-to-know-about-the-musical-artist.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Illymation Bi?
