His wild antics, both on, and off screen, as well as his candid conversations about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his struggles with addiction</a>, have made Brand both a relatable, and likable celebrity that commands the attention of millions of fans each time he speaks. He continues to expand on his already impressive net worth of $20 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=turning-heads-with-his-career>Turning Heads With His Career</h2><p>Born in Essex in 1975, Brand grew up to be a very eccentric, vocal, expressive child that wasn't at all shy in front of the cameras. He eagerly took on any challenge, both personal and career-oriented, and seemed to leap into fame without hesitation or too much planned crafting. He has done everything from acting on the small screen, the big screen, the comedy stage, podcasts, and has even delved into writing and hosting over the years.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An activist at heart, and a fearless leader by nature</a>, Brand confidently expresses himself in whatever way he feels comfortable, and is never one to tiptoe around sensitive topics or situations. He was first scouted at&nbsp;the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year&nbsp;when he was just&nbsp;25 and he went on to start working at MTV that same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cameras have been on him, ever since.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021's Top 4 Richest Stand Up Comedians In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=when-brand-became-a-brand>When Brand Became A Brand</h2><p>Whether you're a fan of Brand's antics, or someone that is just now discovering his outspoken ways, there is one thing that nobody can deny; he effortlessly and skillfully commands&nbsp;his audience.</p><p>Brand has an innate ability to convey his thoughts without putting much emphasis on what the results of that communication may be. He's far less concerned with how people will act or react to the statements he makes, than he is about being able to freely engage people by sharing his uninhibited thoughts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By doing so, Russell Brand has attracted<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a huge fan following, comprised of people that are truly mesmerized by his candid rants </a>and reviews, and entertained by the fact that he puts himself in the hot seat in order to create platforms of discussion for other people across the globe. Russel Brand has essentially created his own brand... and is known as being a critical thinker and vocal advocate for all he believes in.</p><p>His fans, are all-in.</p><h2 id=some-of-the-super-cool-things-he-has-done>Some Of The Super Cool Things He Has Done</h2><p>Russell's career has been a long one that is jam-packed with a series of cool projects, fun jobs, and interesting moments. He has always presented himself as a truly extroverted, eccentric character,&nbsp;and has been fortunate enough to dabble in a variety of very cool projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has created his very own&nbsp;comedy documentary called RE:Brand, which garnered a lot of attention and served as an opportunity&nbsp;for him to pursue other television jobs, such as his<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> involvement in Big Brotherâ€™s spin-off show</a>, Big Brotherâ€™s Big Mouth.</p><p>He has worked in radio and hosted&nbsp;The Russell Brand Show on BBC&nbsp; in 2006, then went on to launch his nation-wide tour that very same year. He was soon recognized as being a successful presenter and actor and explored life on the big screen when he appeared in movies such as St Trinianâ€™s, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No stranger to the microphone</a>, he also&nbsp;"leant his voice to the character Dr. Nefario in the popular Universal movies, Despicable Me and the sequel."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has since gone on to write a number of books that delve into his not-so-secret struggles with addiction. He has even penned children's books, which feature widely different content. His notable published works include;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Booky Wook, Booky Wook 2: This Time It's Personal, Russell Brand's Trickster Tales: The Pied Piper of Hamelin, Revolution and most recently, Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions."</p><p>Over the span of his career,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Brand has appeared in well over a dozen movies and television shows, </a>multiple podcasts including The Russell Brand Podcast and Under The Skin With Russell Brand, and continues to earn an impressive income by sharing his thoughts and views to all those that are interested in hearing his perspective.</p><p>He currently commands a massive fan following and has well over 4.8 million subscribers on his YouTube channel alone. He is enormously influential, and the world is tuning in.</p><h2 id=maintaining-relevance>Maintaining Relevance</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Russell Brand has created waves of controversy among his fans and followers, by speaking openly and candidly about topics that are sensitive to many. Much of his content is disagreeable to his viewers, but he doesn't shy away from pushing his audience to convey their opinions, whether they are agreeable to his, or not. He believes in freedom of speech and expression, and a lot of times, that means he isn't on everyone's list of favorites. He's highly controversial in his approach, and his views, and stirs the pot of popular opinion quite regularly. As a result, Brand continues to remain relevant, continues to gain followers on social media, and maintains his fame by remaining in the spotlight.</p><p>Like him, or leave him, Russell Brand's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial moments </a>continue to keep him in the public eye, and he monetizes on the attention in a very big way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=creating-waves-of-controversy>Creating Waves Of Controversy</h2><p>The level of controversy created by Brand isn't just restricted to his podcasts and the public forums he speaks on. It is also parlayed by his actions, and his brazen form of conveying his eccentric personality.</p><p>During his time as a video journalist on MTV, he did something that was far too much for most people to absorb and was definitely not something they were comfortable getting behind. Just one day after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the tragedy that struck New York on September 11th, 2001</a>, he came to work dressed as Osama bin Laden. This was typical Brand behavior, but it was just too much, too soon. He was subsequently fired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2006 he was the host&nbsp;of a BBC Radio&nbsp; show called The Russell Brand Show. For reasons unknown, or at the very least unidentified, Brand called Andrew Sachs and claimed he had engaged in intimate relations with his grand daughter. This eyebrow-raising moment ultimately led to his suspension.</p><p>These days, he is fully established and settled in his career, and continues to make waves with his personality and outspoken demeanor. Brand continues to pad his bank account with layers of income through his exposure in the media and the world of entertainment, and is forecasted to exponentially increase <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his already astounding $20 million net worth.</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Multi-Million-Dollar Celebrity Couples Are Creating The Most Buzz In 2022</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Express UK</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2r7%2FInZxmqqWowKa4y2aZq5memcBufo9mpKKknJ68r3nToZitZZakv7XBzZ5knKeeqbavwcSsZK2nXZy%2FsMOO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-russell-brand-s-20-million-that-fortune-continues-to-grow.html&text=Inside%20Russell%20Brand%27s%20%2420%20Million%20That%20Fortune%20Continues%20To%20Grow&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-russell-brand-s-20-million-that-fortune-continues-to-grow.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-russell-brand-s-20-million-that-fortune-continues-to-grow.html&title=Inside%20Russell%20Brand%27s%20%2420%20Million%20That%20Fortune%20Continues%20To%20Grow" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-russell-brand-s-20-million-that-fortune-continues-to-grow.html&title=Inside%20Russell%20Brand%27s%20%2420%20Million%20That%20Fortune%20Continues%20To%20Grow" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-russell-brand-s-20-million-that-fortune-continues-to-grow.html&title=Inside%20Russell%20Brand%27s%20%2420%20Million%20That%20Fortune%20Continues%20To%20Grow" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-russell-brand-s-20-million-that-fortune-continues-to-grow.html&description=Inside%20Russell%20Brand%27s%20%2420%20Million%20That%20Fortune%20Continues%20To%20Grow" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lindsay-lohan-is-engaged-to-bf-bader-shammas-after-2-years-of-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lindsay Lohan Is Engaged to BF Bader Shammas After 2 Years of Dating">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./here-s-what-happened-to-the-kids-in-these-classic-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What Happened To The Kids In These Classic Movies">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
