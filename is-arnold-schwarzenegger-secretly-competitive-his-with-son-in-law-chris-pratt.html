That said, there is absolutely no doubt that Schwarzenegger has worked tirelessly to attain everything he accomplished in his life.<a href=#>Able to become a legendary bodybuilder</a>, actor, and politician, Arnold has proven time and time again that he can survive in a slew of competitive businesses. In fact, it seems like Arnold actually thrives when he has someone to compete against.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Photos Show How Much Arnold Schwarzenegger Has Changed Over The Years</a></span>Even though Arnold clearly loves to compete, it also is clear that he has a soft and tender side too. A perfect example of that is when it comes to his daughter, <a href=#>Arnold is happy to profess how much he loves Katherine</a>.When Katherine married Chris Pratt in 2019, Arnold gained a son-in-law. With that in mind, some people have expected Arnold to be a big softie when it comes to Chris. However, considering Arnold's desire to beat out his peers, that begs an obvious question, is Schwarzenegger competitive with his son-in-law?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-competitive-is-arnold-schwarzenegger>How Competitive Is Arnold Schwarzenegger?</h2><p>During the '80s, Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in so many hit movies that he pretty much was in a world of his own. However, there was one other action star who was on the same level as Arnold, Sylvester Stallone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Has A Higher Net Worth: Arnold Schwarzenegger Or Sylvester Stallone?</a></span></p><p>Given that Arnold and Sylvester were so famous, there were very few people who could relate to what they were going through. As a result, it would have made sense if Arnold and Sly quickly became best friends.</p><p>On the bright side, Arnold and Sylvester have a close bond these days. However, back in the heyday of their careers, Arnold and Sylvester had a rivalry that was so intense that there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the height of Arnold and Sylvester's rivalry, things got so out of hand that Schwarzenegger was able to trick Stallone into starring in two movies that flopped. All Arnold had to do was convince Sylvester that he wanted a role and then Stallone would do everything he could to land the role he thought Schwarzenegger wanted.</p><p>On another occasion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold tricked another actor who was his rival</a>.</p><p>During the production of the movie Predator, Arnold convinced the wardrobe department to pretend his bicep was smaller than reality. When Jesse Ventura saw the fake measurements, he believed his bicep was larger than Arnold's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A couple of days later, Jesse fell into Arnold's trap. Thinking that his arm was bigger, Jesse challenged Arnold to a bet. After someone got out a tape measure and Arnold's arm turned out to be bigger, Jesse was forced to buy Schwarzenegger a bottle of champagne.</p><p>Jesse has also said that he and Arnold had a competition to see who could get to the gym first each morning. Clearly, Arnold is an extremely competitive person0</p><h2 id=does-arnold-schwarzenegger-get-along-with-his-son-in-law-chris-pratt>Does Arnold Schwarzenegger Get Along With His Son-In-Law Chris Pratt?</h2><p>When Arnold Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver in 1986, he became a member of a legendary political family. However, even though Shriver is related to the Kennedy family since JFK was her uncle, it could be argued that Arnold was the most famous living member of the family for a long time.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>A Look At Arnold Schwarzenegger And Maria Shriver's Relationship Today</a></p><p>Even though Arnold was one of the biggest action movie stars of all time, the truth is it has been many years since he last starred in a hugely successful film. For that reason, there is no doubt that Arnold isn't as famous as he once was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Arnold's daughter Katherine Schwarzenegger married Chris Pratt. Given the fact that Chris stars in the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe's</a> Guardians of the Galaxy movies, it can be argued that Pratt currently is more famous than his father-in-law.</p><p>Not long after Katherine and Chris walked down the aisle, Arnold was interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel. During the resulting conversation, Arnold was asked about his son-in-law and praised Chris unreservedly.</p><p>"I'm really happy that he is such a great guy. Not only a very talented guy and a great actor and a great star and all this stuff, but a really kind man and kind to my daughter, which is the most important thing for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it was sweet to hear Arnold praise Chris like that, it didn't take long for Schwarzenegger's competitive side to come out. After all, Arnold went on to talk about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his hilarious reaction to his daughter marrying a huge movie star</a>.</p><p>"I was blown away when my daughter was telling me that she was going out with him. Because I said to myself, 'Do you have to be so competitive?"</p><p>"'I mean, do you have to have a guy that is taller than me, that is bigger than me, that is doing bigger movies than me, all this kind of stuff that makes more money than me? What is going on here?' I think it was really wild to all of a sudden have this guy in the family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Arnold seemed to be having fun when he made those statements. That said, considering how competitive Arnold has always been, there is every reason to take his comments seriously. At the end of the day, everyone can draw their own conclusion about how serious Arnold was after watching the interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHqxvsCtq2avmZuybrLArZ%2Beql2Wv6%2B7y51krJuYrK6zxsSnnKCflad6s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-arnold-schwarzenegger-secretly-competitive-his-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt.html&text=Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%20Secretly%20Competitive%20His%20With%20Son-In-Law%2c%20Chris%20Pratt%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-arnold-schwarzenegger-secretly-competitive-his-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-arnold-schwarzenegger-secretly-competitive-his-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt.html&title=Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%20Secretly%20Competitive%20His%20With%20Son-In-Law%2c%20Chris%20Pratt%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-arnold-schwarzenegger-secretly-competitive-his-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt.html&title=Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%20Secretly%20Competitive%20His%20With%20Son-In-Law%2c%20Chris%20Pratt%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-arnold-schwarzenegger-secretly-competitive-his-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt.html&title=Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%20Secretly%20Competitive%20His%20With%20Son-In-Law%2c%20Chris%20Pratt%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-arnold-schwarzenegger-secretly-competitive-his-with-son-in-law-chris-pratt.html&description=Is%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger%20Secretly%20Competitive%20His%20With%20Son-In-Law%2c%20Chris%20Pratt%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./martin-st-louis-nhl-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martin St. Louis (NHL) Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-money-did-hugh-grant-turn-down-to-replace-charlie-sheen-in-two-and-a-half-men.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Did Hugh Grant Turn Down To Replace Charlie Sheen In Two And A Half Men?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
