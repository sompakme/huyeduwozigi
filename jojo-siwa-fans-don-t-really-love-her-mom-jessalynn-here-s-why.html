However, JoJo's fans don't really love her mother, they have accused the polarizing star of using her daughter's fame to get ahead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>JoJo's rise to stardom has had its downside, like the constant bullying she was subjected to both on and off the show. JoJo even changed her look! Even though viewers sympathized with her, they weren't pleased with her mother's behavior on the sixth season of Dance Moms. Fans called out Jessalynn for her 'mean girl' behavior and have continued to do so.</p><h2 id=jojo-has-been-a-victim-of-bullying>JoJo Has Been A Victim Of Bullying</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jojo-and-jessalynn-siwa.jpg><p>JoJo is a star and has earned herself scores of fans worldwide. She is a polarizing character who has had to <a href=#>remind her haters that she loves herself</a>.</p><p>She has been subjected to bullying and ridicule over the years, Siwa's journey hasn't always been easy. Furthermore, she's been bullied for her hairline, her weight, and her sense of style, both in the virtual and real world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How JoJo Siwa Went From Dancer To Billionaire Businesswoman</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a conversation with the other JoJo, for Variety's Power of Young Hollywood series</a>, Siwa revealed,"After I was the top meme in October, with people criticizing my hairline and saying I’m a giant toddler, I went to Knott’s Scary Farm, and people were being awful. All these teenagers were, like, 'JoJo Siwa, F– you! Go home.' All night long, people were shouting things at me. So, I just thought teenagers don’t like me. And I am one! But I didn’t have any teenage friends, and I do now."</p><h2 id=fans-don-39-t-really-love-jessalynn>Fans Don't Really Love Jessalynn</h2><p>JoJo's fan base has grown tremendously throughout her career. However, fans don't really love JoJo's mother. Apparently, Jessalynn was a bully during season six of Dance Moms.</p><p>She allegedly bullied a child, made fun of another mom's appearance and was all-around awful. Viewers called her out for doing the exact thing that was done to her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Redditor wrote</a>, "I have liked JoJo since she first joined Dance Moms, and I still honestly love how she handles any criticism toward her on social media. However, I find it kind of cringey that her mom was one of the biggest bullies on the show, while JoJo’s whole image is based on anti-bullying."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Has Jessalynn Siwa Been Up To Since 'Dance Moms'?</a></span></p><p>Another one added, "I completely agree. Jess was a bully, plain and simple. Mom drama is one thing, but to literally insult a child to their face is a whole different level of terrible. You can tell it wasn’t even producer-manufactured drama because of Brynn’s 'reacting to dance moms' video where she mentioned how mean the moms were to her. I can’t imagine how awful of a person you have to be a fully grown adult with children of your own who is purposefully mean to other kids."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jojo-39-s-mom-continues-to-rub-some-fans-the-wrong-way>JoJo's Mom Continues To Rub Some Fans The Wrong way</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jojo-siwa-making-an-interesting-face.jpg><p>JoJo and Jessalynn's Dance Mom days are long behind them, but in July 2022, conversations about Jess' time on the show were started again.</p><p>This was owing to the fact that JoJo revealed an incident that happened between her and Candace Cameron Bure in 2014. Jess weighed in, and some fans accused her of looking for her 15 minutes of fame.</p><p>She shared a short video of her podcast on her Instagram account, in which she recounted how Candace refused to take a picture with JoJo. Apparently, Bure was dismissive of JoJo.</p><p>Jess also questioned Bure's morals and fans weren't having it, considering the Fuller House alum had already apologized to JoJo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessalynn was accused of stirring up drama and she and JoJo were called out for 'being entitled' and 'spoiled brats.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Went Down Between JoJo Siwa And Full House's Candace Cameron Bure?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One commenter wrote</a>, "So you were “obsessed” with the show and because your daughter got snubbed, you thought you and your daughter would still rake her through the coals so you can draw more attention to something that happened years ago. How about you now take the high ground, use your “morals” and give it a rest after she had apologized. In other words…grow up."</p><p>Jessalynn has often been accused of exploiting Jojo and being fame hungry which another commenter alluded to in the comment section of the video.</p><p>They wrote, "But see, that's how Jess makes her living - off of her daughter and the drama they can stir up. It's really sad."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the other comments on the post included "Just another attempt to suck off of her daughter's fame.
