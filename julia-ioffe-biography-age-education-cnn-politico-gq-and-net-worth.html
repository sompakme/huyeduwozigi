However, details regarding her actual height and other body measurements are currently not publicly available. We are keeping tabs and will update this information once it is out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-parents></span>Julia Ioffe Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Our efforts to find out more about Julia’s family came to no avail as no such information is publicly available. Thus, the identity of her parents is still unclear. It is also not known if she has any siblings.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-partner-julia-ioffe-wedding></span>Julia Ioffe Partner | Julia Ioffe Wedding<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In as much as Julia may be relatively considered a public figure due to the nature of her work, not much of her personal life is known to the public. This may be attributed to the fact that she covers the newsmakers and not her own story.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-education></span>Julia Ioffe Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julia was born in Russia but later at the age of 7, her family relocated to the United States. They emigrated as refugees escaping anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. Her family later settled in Columbia, Maryland where Julia attended Beth Tfiloh Dehan Community School and graduated in 2001.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span></p><p>She proceeded to Princeton University where she majored in Soviet History and Russian Literature. Her last university project which was the study of the Soviet connection to the Spanish speaking world won Julia an award with Davis Prize and also received a cash grant of $6,000. During her time in the university, Julia was the vice president of the Princeton Israel Public Affairs Committee.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-career></span>Julia Ioffe Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-gq></span>Julia Ioffe GQ<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Julia is currently a political reporter for GQ, an international monthly men’s magazine which was founded in 1931 and is based in New York City. Its publication puts more emphasis on topics such as fashion, style, and culture for men. Furthermore, articles containing topics on food, movies, fitness, sex, music, travel, sports, technology, books, and some other topics are also attributed.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-cnn></span>Julia Ioffe CNN<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Julia featured in ‘The Lead with Jake Tapper’ an afternoon early evening newscast hosted by Jake Tapper on CNN stating that President Donald Trump has radicalized so many people than ISIS ever did, pointing a 60% increase in antisemitism during 2017.</p><p>Her statement received pushback from David Urban and Mona Charen, her fellow panelists. Nevertheless, she later apologized for her statement which she termed as ‘Hyperbole’ during the broadcast and also on twitter. Trump, in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News, called Julia some kind of a sick woman referring to her comments about him.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-politico></span>Julia Ioffe Politico<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Julia in May 2016 became a contributing writer at Politico, an American political opinion company based in Virginia. She is also the first journalist to profile Steven Miller, Trump’s policy and speechwriter. Ioffe also wrote an article about ‘Cater Page’ an American petroleum industry consultant and former foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential elections, who has had many years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span></p><p>Ioffe, in December 2016, issued a tweet directed to Donald Trump suggesting that he was involved in a sexual relationship with his daughter, for which after being blasted she later apologized by deleting and expressing the tweet as ‘offensive and tasteless. Julia was eventually fired from Politico. The Atlantic reported that it was hiring Ioffe to tackle topics on national security, foreign policy, and politics, with an editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg describing her as “an enthusiastic reporter”.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-atlantic></span>Julia Ioffe Atlantic<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In early 2017, Julia joined The Atlantic as a corespondent between Donald Trump Jr. and WikiLeaks for ten months, which played a vital role in the presidential campaign and is alleged to being an agent of Kremlin intelligence. Julia found out that “even if Trump’s older son mostly ignored the endless messages from WikiLeaks, he at some point appears to have acted on its pleas and shared that information with Donald Trump’s senior campaign officials”.</p><p>Julia was also the first to receive the whole e-mail correspondence between Trump’s campaign chief Paul Manafort and Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin. The article disclosed that “Manafort tried to grasp his leadership role in the Trump campaign to relish favor with a Russian oligarch close to Vladimir Putin”.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-facts-and-body-measurements></span><b data-stringify-type=bold>Julia Ioffe Facts and Body Measurements</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here are some interesting facts you don’t want to miss about Julia Ioffe.</p><p><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Full Name</b>:&nbsp; Julia Ioffe.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Date of Birth</b>: 1982<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Age/ How old?: </b>About 38 years old.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Place of Birth</b>: Moscow, Russia.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Birthday</b>: Not Available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Nationality</b>: American.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Fathers Name</b>: Not Available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Mothers Name</b>: Not available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Siblings: </b>Not Available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Marital Status</b>: Not Available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Children/ Kids</b>: Not Available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Height/ How tall?</b>: Not Available.<br><b data-stringify-type=bold>• Weight</b>: Not Available.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julia-ioffe-salary></span>Julia Ioffe Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>GQ salaries range from an average of $33,774 to $112,519 a year.
