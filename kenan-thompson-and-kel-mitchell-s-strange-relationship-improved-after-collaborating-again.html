The two young teenagers not only formed a friendship while filming the show, but developed an on-screen chemistry fans could not resist. Recognizing Thompson and Mitchell's popularity, Nickelodeon decided to give them their own show: Kenan & Kel.</p><p>Thompson and Mitchell's dynamic duo era also led them to co-star in their own movie together, The Good Burger, in 1997. As time went on, however, Thompson and Mitchell went their seperate ways and began to have a complicated relationship. Fortunately for the two comics, they were able to improve their relationship after joining forces once again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-kenan-thompson-and-kel-mitchell-have-a-complicated-relationship-after-their-years-of-success-together>Why Did Kenan Thompson And Kel Mitchell Have A Complicated Relationship After Their Years Of Success Together?</h2><p>Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell were, at one point, two of the most famous kids in America. They co-starred on shows together and became brand ambassadors for the growing Nickelodeon cable network. All That introduced them to a generation, and Kenan & Kel and The Good Burger cemented their fame.</p><p>At the height of their early fame, Thompson and Mitchell were nearly unstoppable. They became the face of youthful comedy, alongside other Nickeleoden stars such as Amanda Bynes, whom Thompson and Mitchell <a href=# rel=nofollow>have been supportive of</a> in her later personal struggles. Once their peak of teenage fame passed, however, Thompson and Mitchell did what most young adults try to do. They <strong>tried to find themselves and their path in the world</strong>, which ultimately led them to go <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">their seperate ways</a>, according to Entertainment Weekly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kenan-thompson-and-kel-mitchell-2022-people-s-choice-awards.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thompson explained his complicated relationship with Mitchell candidly in an interview,</p><p>" It was more of a seperation that kind of grew into the traditional terms of what a falling out is, which is like not a lot of communication."</p><p>The SNL star credits growing up as a key factor to why they lost touch. "Originally, it was just us kind of looking for our own individualism, basically, as adults, taking a breather from being a duo because we both came into the game as individuals. And we were placed together because we worked so well together and all that. It was just a journey of being adults."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mitchell agreed in the sentiment, according to US Weekly. "You have to think about it, when you're adulting within the limelight and you are just trying to find yourself within this business...we just went different ways. But I think that happens with everybody. It's like when you're in high school and your friends went to different colleges, but then you stayed in contact and now you're experiencing life as adults now. It's just such an awesome thing. And to still be friends afrer that entire journey is awesome."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kenan-thompson-and-kel-mitchell-s-strange-relationship-improved-after-collaborating-again-front-back-_deposit-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering the impact of childhood/teenagerhood fame, Thompson and Mitchell's healthy desire to find themselves can be commended. The young men wanted to explore the next chapter in their lives, and needed space. Thompson continued the comedy route, and became an international star through SNL. Mitchell continued to pursue the entertainment business also, and did voice work for Clifford The Big Red Dog in the early 2000's. Mitchell, however, struggled to remain famous, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>never got the attention</a> that his former co-star did. Interestingly, Mitchell<a href=# rel=nofollow> found a calling </a>to become a pastor and became involved in minstry after his Nickelodeon era.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kel-mitchell-all-that-good-burger.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Here's How Kel Mitchell Amassed His $3 Million Net Worth">Here's How Kel Mitchell Amassed His $3 Million Net Worth</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Did the '90s boost Kel Mitchell's net worth?

According to Thompson, they picked up right where they left off once they began to talk again. "When you have a real friendship. it was five minutes into the phone call, we were back. It was like, what were we waiting on all this time? You just never know until you actually have that talk", Thompson explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kenan-thompson-and-kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-float-macy-s-thanksgiving-day-parade-deposit.jpg><p>As Thompson discussed his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rekindled relationship with Mitchell</a>, regret was on his mind, according to US Weekly. "It's also time wasted, which is one of the biggest crimes I think you can do in life, is just waste time." Fortunately for Thompson and Mitchell, the strong bond that formed in their youth was still present.</p><h2 id=how-the-good-burger-2-helped-kenan-thompson-and-kel-mitchell-become-close-again>How The Good Burger 2 Helped Kenan Thompson And Kel Mitchell Become Close Again</h2><p>Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell <strong>especially bonded again</strong> on the set of The Good Burger 2. Collaborating together was just what the pair needed to <strong>rejuvenate their personal and professional relationship.</strong> According to Thompson, filming The Good Burger 2 was a very positive experience. "It feels so good to be back with my brother...We're so appreciative, looking forward to the next chapters. It was just so natural, just fun, to work with my brother and just laugh all day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mitchell spoke highly of working on The Good Burger 2 with Thompson as well. "It's a brotherhood. It's really a brotherhood. We were praying together right before we went out to [announce the Good Burger 2 news on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon] and [had] a bunch of hugs and laughs all day. You know what I mean? That's my bro so this is fun to us", Mitchell said in an exclusive US Weekly interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kenan-thompson-and-kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-premiere.jpg><p>The Good Burger 2 not only helped improve Thompson and Mitchell's relationship, but introduced them to a completely new generation.
