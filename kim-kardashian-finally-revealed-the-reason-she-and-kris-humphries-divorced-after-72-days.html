On top of that, many fans are interested in her marriage to and divorce from Kris Humphries. For example, fans want to know <a href=#>how Kardashian's siblings felt about Humphries</a> and why she divorced him so quickly.</p><p>This article will take a look back at <strong>why Kardashian married Humphries</strong> in the first place.

One example of that is the fact that Kardashian has repeatedly been asked to <strong>explain her quick and failed marriage to Kris Humphries</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_kim-kardashian-s-siblings-had-a-complicated-relationship-with-her-ex-husband-kris-humphries_bk_a1_v2.jpg><p>While talking to Alan Carr, Kardashian revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her idealistic belief in love is what resulted in her disastrous marriage</a> to Humphries. Kardashian also cited the pressure of comparing her life to what was going on with the people around her.</p><p>"You know, I think that I'm the kind of girl, like, I'm such a hopeless romantic, and all my friends around, are married with babies. I just, I really want that. That's what, to me, like, success is, is having a family and, you know, a partner. And when I met him, I thought that's what I saw in him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kardashian then went on to say that <strong>rushing into their marriage</strong> played a major role in her failed relationship with Humphries.</p><p>"And, you know, we never lived together before we got married. So, I think it was, just how it all happened so fast. I kind of, you know, I did fall in love, but I think I got caught up and, and everything that was going on around it."</p><p>Kardashian then went on to describe how she quickly came to realize that<strong> marrying Humphries was a mistake</strong>.</p><p>"And, once we did move in together, I realized fast that this wasn't for me. Doesn't mean that he's not a great person and I don't love him. It's just not, it just wasn't for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kim-kardashian-and-kris-humphries-before-their-divorce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a vulnerable moment, Kardashian also explained what the <strong>motivation behind filing to divorce Humphries so quickly</strong> was.</p><p>"So I figured that it was easier to get out and quicker, and it would, in the, in the long run save a lot of people's hearts. And it's so embarrassing, obviously, having this huge wedding on TV and doing that. Like, most people would have stayed."</p><p>At that point in the conversation, Carr asked Kardashian to clarify that <strong>she didn't marry Humphries for publicity</strong>. Not only did Kardashian state that wasn't the case, she talked about how hurtful it was that anyone thought she would do that.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/does-caitlyn-jenner-get-along-with-her-children-today-or-are-they-still-not-talking-after-years-of-conflict_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is Caitlyn Jenner Devastated By Her Relationships With Her Children?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Caitlyn Jenner's once close relationship with her famous daughters has gone through some very hard times amidst feuds and anger.</span><p>E! clearly didn't think that Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries getting married was a mistake for the network.
