She grew up alongside her twin sister, Dawn, and a younger sister named Casandra. Kim’s parents, Kathleen Sluck and Casimer Sluck, divorced when she was still a child, and her mother remarried a man named John Briggs.</p><p>Kim dropped out of high school in her junior year and started working as a waitress to support herself. During this time, she met Marshall Mathers, better known by his stage name <b>Eminem</b>, at a house party. The two started dating and eventually got married in 1999. Kim and Marshall have gone through several separations and reconciliations, with their marriage ending in divorce in 2006.</p><table><tr><th>Birth Name</th><td>Kimberly Anne Scott</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>January 9th, 1975</td></tr><tr><th>Place of Birth</th><td>Warren, Michigan</td></tr><tr><th>Parents</th><td><ul><li>Kathleen Sluck (mother)</li><li>Casimer Sluck (father)</li><li>John Briggs (stepfather)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Siblings</th><td><ul><li>Dawn Scott (twin sister)</li><li>Casandra Sluck (younger sister)</li></ul></td></tr></table><p>Kim has faced several personal struggles throughout her life, including addiction issues and legal troubles.
