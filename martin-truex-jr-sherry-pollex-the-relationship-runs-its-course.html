From the race track to fighting cancer, their strength and determination have not sloped down.</p><p>NASCAR driver Martin Truex Jr. and his longtime partner, Sherry Pollex, have decided to end their <a href=#>relationship</a>.</p><p>Sherry, who is 44 years old, has been fighting ovarian cancer since 2014.</p><p>Martin Truex Jr. announced his breakup in a post on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. He said, <strong>“To all my fans and partners, I want to let you know that Sherry and I have made the decision to end our relationship.”</strong></p><p>He added, <strong>“Even though we are not together anymore, I will still be there to support Sherry. We would appreciate it if you could respect our privacy and not ask any more questions about this.”</strong></p><p>Martin Truex Jr and Sherry Pollex’s relationship has positively impacted their lives and the racing community.</p><p>Their love story inspires many, showing the power of love, resilience, and the importance of standing by each other during challenging times.</p><p>Born in New Jersey, Martin is a famous NASCAR driver who has had a successful career in racing.</p><p>Sherry has been by his side for a long time, supporting him in his races while suffering from cancer herself.</p><p>After loving and supporting each other for many years, recently, they decided to walk on their separate paths.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin and Sherry’s relationship journey</h2><p>Martin Truex Jr. and Sherry Pollex had a long and meaningful relationship. They have been together for many years and have supported each other through thick and thin.</p><p>The former couple faced many challenges together and built a strong bond.</p><p>Their love story began years ago when they first met. They quickly formed a deep connection and became inseparable.</p><p>Martin and Sherry have been by each other’s side through the ups and downs of life. They have celebrated victories and supported each other during difficult times.</p><p>One significant challenge that they faced together was Sherry’s ovarian cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Since her diagnosis in 2014, Martin has been her pillar of strength.</p><p>He has shown unwavering support and has been her biggest cheerleader in the fight against cancer.</p><p>Their relationship has not only been about love and support but also about making a difference in the lives of others.</p><p>Together, they have founded the Martin Truex Jr. Foundation, which aims to help children with pediatric cancer.</p><p>They have worked tirelessly to raise funds and awareness for this cause.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pollex’s ovarian cancer journey</h2><p>Back in 2014, Pollex got some terrible news. The doctors said she had Stage 3 ovarian cancer.</p><p>They told her there was only a 30% chance she would make it through the next five years.</p><p>But guess what? She’s been fighting cancer for eight years now. It goes away for a while, but sooner or later, it comes back.</p><p>In July 2022, Pollex told a reporter named Jeff Gluck that her cancer had returned. This time, it spread to her lungs.</p><p>The doctors tried different treatments, but none of them worked very well.</p><p>She is still fighting cancer with utmost determination and will hopefully recover from it completely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Martin secures third place at Charlotte Motor Speedway</h2><p>Martin achieved an impressive third-place finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway on the evening of May 29, 2023.</p><p>Leading three Toyotas among the top-five finishers in the rain-delayed 600-mile race was a remarkable accomplishment.</p><p>Bubba Wallace secured fourth place, while Tyler Reddick claimed fifth place in the race.</p><p>In a post-race interview, Martin described the event as challenging for him and his fellow racers.</p><p>In addition, Martin commended the speed of their car, the Tracker Boats Camry and Bass Pro Shops, which helped them navigate through difficulties on the track.</p><p>Towards the end of stage three, Martin believed victory was within reach.</p><p>However, an unexpected collision with the splitter caused the car to become overly tight, ultimately affecting their chances of winning.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5wKuroqZdqb%2B2sddmoatlo52ys77YZqeopJyaxXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmartin-truex-jr-sherry-pollex-the-relationship-runs-its-course.html&text=Martin%20Truex%20Jr%20Sherry%20Pollex%20%20The%20Relationship%20Runs%20Its%20Course&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmartin-truex-jr-sherry-pollex-the-relationship-runs-its-course.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-truex-jr-sherry-pollex-the-relationship-runs-its-course.html&title=Martin%20Truex%20Jr%20Sherry%20Pollex%20%20The%20Relationship%20Runs%20Its%20Course" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmartin-truex-jr-sherry-pollex-the-relationship-runs-its-course.html&title=Martin%20Truex%20Jr%20Sherry%20Pollex%20%20The%20Relationship%20Runs%20Its%20Course" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmartin-truex-jr-sherry-pollex-the-relationship-runs-its-course.html&title=Martin%20Truex%20Jr%20Sherry%20Pollex%20%20The%20Relationship%20Runs%20Its%20Course" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmartin-truex-jr-sherry-pollex-the-relationship-runs-its-course.html&description=Martin%20Truex%20Jr%20Sherry%20Pollex%20%20The%20Relationship%20Runs%20Its%20Course" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maven-coming-out-of-retirement-for-ispw-in-new-jersey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maven Coming Out Of Retirement For ISPW In New Jersey">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./het-thakkar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Het Thakkar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
