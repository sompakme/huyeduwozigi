Simpson went from being one of the NFL's biggest talents to a convicted felon, but he did not die a pauper. A portion of his income was meant to be paid to Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman's families</strong>. However, it wasn't easy to determine because, according to Page Six, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">requested that he be paid in cash</a>. This included podcast appearances, autograph signings, and golf trips.</p><p>"He would sign anything except anything that had to do with the trial or murder," an insider told the publication. "The stipulation was always that he had to be paid in cash." They added, "With being paid everything in cash, there was no way to document how much money he had access to." This makes it incredibly hard to determine Simpson's actual income in the last few years and perhaps does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not accurately reflect his net worth</a>, estimated at $3 million – a sum that pales compared to his earnings in the 90s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-o-j-simpson-owe-millions-in-debt>Why Did O.J.

Although Simpson was not found guilty on these charges in his 1995 trial, he would later be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">found liable for their deaths in a civil case</a>, the Associated Press reports. Simpson was <a href=#>ordered to pay the respective families</a>. According to People, <strong>Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, claimed that Simpson owed his family over $100 million</strong>, a claim the family's lawyer, David Cook, commented on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He died without penance," Cook told People. "He did not want to give a dime, a nickel to Fred, never, anything, never." The publication also notes that since the 1997 trial, Simpson is believed to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid just $133,000 to the family</a>. "He [still] owes on the current status of the judgment," Cook said of a court judgment from 2022.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/oj-simpson-trial.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>OJ Simpson's Idea Of A "Joke" With An Interviewer Didn't Go The Way He Expected</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>OJ Simpson rattled an interviewer when he played a "joke" that no one thought was funny.</span><p>The family also made a statement after Simpson's death.

In an interview with People, attorney David Cook said that Goldman's family was looking into their options.
