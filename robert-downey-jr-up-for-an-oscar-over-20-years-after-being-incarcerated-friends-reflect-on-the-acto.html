"<strong>Not a lot of people stood by his side, it was a very small group, that's just the reality. It was a couple of dear friends. They love to put you up at the top to knock the s**t out of you and watch you crawl back up and give you a nice little entryway to get back in and a path to redemption.</strong>"</p><h2 id=robert-credits-his-wife-for-this-drastic-change>Robert Credits His Wife For This Drastic Change</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/robert-downey-jr-and-wife-susan-downey.jpg><p>Robert Downey Jr. met his wife Susan Levin at a very delicate moment in his life.
