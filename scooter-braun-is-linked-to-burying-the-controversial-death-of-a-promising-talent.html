Some think it's related to <a href=#>his legal dispute</a> with <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>.

The report revealed that on March 30 this year, the 24-year-old talent "took the elevator up to Room 2805 of the Setai Hotel's VIP Ocean Suites [in Miami] ... to visit David Bolno, Scooter Braun's business partner and the money manager for stars like <strong><a href=#>Drake</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Post Malone</a></strong>."</p><p>Around 4:30 a.m., Bolno went out and left Sterling in the room. She was found dead in the bathtub about eight hours later when the concierge noticed that no one had checked out. In the photograph of the scene, there were "tusi, a drug cocktail containing MDMA and ketamine" and "a condom wrapper in the garbage." Official reports say that Sterling had died of accidental overdose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bolno was initially a person of interest until he cooperated with the Miami Beach Police Department. When asked why he was with Sterling at the hotel, the music executive said: "She was recording music the night before. She's a client and she was going to sign a record deal with me. I helped her make music. There's not much more to it."</p><p>His statement proved to be a lie when text messages between him and his talent revealed that he paid rent on her condo. She also referred to him as her "boyfriend," and her friends said that their affair was an "open secret." Bolno, who's married with two children, has been Braun's right-hand man for 17 years.</p><p>"I think he has always been Scooter's executioner. He's the bad guy when he needs to be, and I think that allows Scooter to sort of play the good guy," said a manager who's previously worked with the duo. "Bolno doesn't really do anything that Scooter hasn't already sanctioned or approved from a business point of view."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bolno has effectively detached his name from the case. However, Business Insider wrote that within the upper industry crowd, "everyone knows" what really happened that night. Someone who was doing a business deal with him and Braun noted that the pair had "ghosted" him after Sterling's passing.</p><p>David Bolno was the chief operating officer of Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. He was also "hands-on" during the infamous acquisition of Taylor Swift's masters.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Justin Bieber's Lucrative Calvin Klein Endorsement Deal</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-accuse-scooter-braun-of-exploiting-young-performers>Fans Accuse Scooter Braun Of Exploiting Young Performers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/scooter-braun.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reddit fans think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolno's relationship with Sterling</a> says a lot about Braun's shady business. "This is incredibly sad," one wrote. "I'm sure Scooter and his team have a lot of bad mojo from how they’ve exploited younger performers (especially female ones) to get rich themselves. Time will tell. I feel like any day now there is going to be a disgusting expose about SpiderBoy and/or his boys."</p><p>A commenter replied, citing the first time Grande fired Braun: "I'll never forget that when Ariana fired him the first time around, Scooter did an interview where he said that his team begged him not to take her back and was encouraging him to give stories about her to the press. I read that and was like wtf does he think this makes them look good?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The concerns resonate with the sentiments of Sterling's college friend. "I would go online every single day trying to put in the name, and nothing will come up," they told BI. "There are things beyond our knowledge and understanding when there's power and money involved."</p><p>A producer who had worked with Sterling also thought it was "very odd" that her death didn't get much attention, even when her former colleagues — makeup artists, dancers, producers, etc. — posted their condolences on social media. Here's a closer look at the budding pop star prior to her accidental overdose:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>Camila Sterling tweeted "2022 is my year," referring to her music career</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>April 2022</p></td><td><p>Sterling moved into a $1.4 million condo which David Bolno paid for</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>July 2022</p></td><td><p>Sterling was said to be hanging out on private lanes with new L.A. friends</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>October 2022</p></td><td><p>Sterling released her second single, Moët</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Months before March 2023</p></td><td><p>Sterling and Bolno weren't on good terms</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>March 16, 2023</p></td><td><p>The Music video for Moët was released</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>March 30, 2023</p></td><td><p>Sterling was found dead in the fetal position in her hotel room's bathtub</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ellen Wouldn't Let Taylor Swift Forget This Awkward Confession From One Of Her First Talk Show Appearances</a></span></p><h2 id=why-celebrities-are-leaving-scooter-braun-39-s-management>Why Celebrities Are Leaving Scooter Braun's Management</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ariana-grande-and-demi-lovato-with-their-former-manager-scooter-braun-from-his-instagram-account.jpg><p>In August 2023, Braun's precious stars began to cut ties with him, one by one. Aside from Bieber, Grande, and Lovato, other singers have also fired him, like Broadway fixture and <a href=#>Glee alum Idina Menzel</a>, Colombian "Prince of Reggaeton" J Balvin, Carly Rae Jepsen, BabyJake, and Asher Roth. According to Vox, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This could all just be about K-Pop</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, South Korean studio Hybe, which is responsible for BTS' stardom, acquired Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings. The "billion-dollar merger" is speculated to be keeping the exec too busy to handle his former clients. "Scooter’s team at SB Projects are still handling both Justin and Ariana as they work through what this new structure looks like," a source told the outlet in August 2023.</p><p>Scooter Braun is worth $500 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnKefqbKzecGrmK6mXZ7AbrjIp6KenF2pvG6u1KuwoqaXYsGpsYycpqesoqTDpr7SopilZZSarrW0jKidZpldpb%2BwucisoKefXamurbHNrWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fscooter-braun-is-linked-to-burying-the-controversial-death-of-a-promising-talent.html&text=Scooter%20Braun%20Is%20Linked%20To%20Burying%20The%20Controversial%20Death%20Of%20A%20Promising%20Talent&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscooter-braun-is-linked-to-burying-the-controversial-death-of-a-promising-talent.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscooter-braun-is-linked-to-burying-the-controversial-death-of-a-promising-talent.html&title=Scooter%20Braun%20Is%20Linked%20To%20Burying%20The%20Controversial%20Death%20Of%20A%20Promising%20Talent" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fscooter-braun-is-linked-to-burying-the-controversial-death-of-a-promising-talent.html&title=Scooter%20Braun%20Is%20Linked%20To%20Burying%20The%20Controversial%20Death%20Of%20A%20Promising%20Talent" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fscooter-braun-is-linked-to-burying-the-controversial-death-of-a-promising-talent.html&title=Scooter%20Braun%20Is%20Linked%20To%20Burying%20The%20Controversial%20Death%20Of%20A%20Promising%20Talent" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscooter-braun-is-linked-to-burying-the-controversial-death-of-a-promising-talent.html&description=Scooter%20Braun%20Is%20Linked%20To%20Burying%20The%20Controversial%20Death%20Of%20A%20Promising%20Talent" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-top-10-most-intelligent-people-in-the-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Top 10 Most Intelligent People in the World">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kylie-jenner-sparks-engagement-rumors-as-she-wears-diamond-while-hanging-with-timothee-chalamet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Jenner Sparks Engagement Rumors As She Wears Diamond While Hanging With Timothee Chalamet">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
