The singer’s outfits alone often cost a small fortune.</p><p>In 2017, the former Destiny’s Child member made headlines for <a href=#>making an Instagram post featuring $20,000 in clothing.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The slideshow featured images of Beyonce and Jay-Z on vacation, even some on their private plane. One picture showed Queen B in Saint Laurent over-the-knee boots, worth over $3,500, which was paired with a $2,000 Gucci denim jacket.</p><p>In a different picture, Beyonce could be seen wearing bedazzled boots, also from Saint Laurent, valued at over $10,000.</p><p>Given that they spend tens of thousands of dollars on their vacation outfits, we can’t imagine how much their accommodation and entertainment costs are when traveling.</p><h2 id=beyonce-s-spent-at-least-50-000-on-her-maternity-wardrobe>Beyonce’s Spent At Least $50,000 On Her Maternity Wardrobe</h2><p>When expecting pregnant with her twins in 2017, Beyonce reportedly <a href=#>spent at least $50,000 on her maternity wardrobe</a>. Arguably, the most iconic look she wore at the time was the gold, Grecian-inspired dress and gown, which she performed in at the 2017 Grammy’s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-s-vow-renewal-dress-cost-70-000>Beyonce’s Vow Renewal Dress Cost $70,000</h2><p>In 2018, Beyonce and Jay-Z renewed their vows in honor of their 10th wedding anniversary, and the singer wore a stunning gown inspired by Queen Victoria’s wedding dress. <a href=#>The custom design reportedly cost $70,000</a>.</p><h2 id=beyonce-s-bet-bodysuit-featured-30-000-swarovski-crystals>Beyonce’s BET Bodysuit Featured 30,000 Swarovski Crystals</h2><p>Beyonce stunned at the 2016 BET awards when she performed in a lavish bodysuit that <a href=#>featured 30,000 individual Swarovski Crystals</a>. The piece reportedly took 3 weeks to make by hand and was designed by Julien Macdonald.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not known how much the bodysuit cost, but given the details and amount of crystals need, it’s likely worth tens of thousands, if not more.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>A Glance At Beyoncé’s Dating History: All Of Her Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonce-s-grammy-dress-later-sold-for-250-000>Beyonce’s Grammy Dress Later Sold For $250,000</h2><p>For the 2014 Grammy Awards, Beyonce dazzled in a stunning white Michael Costello gown, valued at $20,000. But having a dress worn by Beyonce apparently increases its overall worth, as a <a href=#>superfan later offered to buy the dress for $250,000</a>.</p><h2 id=beyonce-has-a-collection-of-birkin-bags>Beyonce Has A Collection Of Birkin Bags</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Birkin bags are one of the most coveted purses on the planet, with people needing a direct invitation from the designer to purchase, unless they score one second-hand.</p><p>Beyonce reportedly has a collection of Birkins, and we’re guessing they weren’t pre-loved. The singer doesn’t have just one or two, either, but instead has a whole collection. Jay-Z reportedly surprised her a series of Birkin bags at once, <a href=#>valued at over $350,000</a>.</p><p>It's unclear how much Beyonce’s entire purse collection is worth, but her taste for designer labels suggests that it could easily be worth millions.</p><h2 id=she-wore-7-5-million-in-jewelry-for-a-dubai-performance>She Wore $7.5 Million In Jewelry For A Dubai Performance</h2><p>Earlier this year, Beyonce made a controversial performance in Dubai to celebrate the opening of a new hotel, Atlantis the Royal. She apparently made a huge paycheck for the concert -- $24 million. The hotel also put her up in their most luxurious penthouse, which costs a cool $100,000 per night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the luxuries didn’t stop there. For the performance itself, <a href=#>Beyonce reportedly wore $7.5 million</a> of Lorraine Schwartz jewelry.</p><p>The singer had multiple costume changes during the performance, and made sure her jewelry matched perfectly each time. She was seen wearing a pair of diamond and green Colombian emerald fan earrings, which features over 100-carats of diamonds. At the same time, she wore a 30-carat yellow diamond ring.</p><p>During another costume change, Beyonce wore teardrop 80-carat earrings plus a halo-inspired crown. Her final outfit for the concert was a bedazzled, pink dress made by Ukrianian designer Ivan Frolov. The matching gloves and stockings featured 60-carats of diamonds alone.</p><p>“<a href=#>The outfit was created in our workshop</a> in Kyiv, Ukraine, during war and massive blackouts […] it just goes to show that no matter what, Ukrainian brands continue to showcase the world their resistance and culture,” the designer told Vogue of the dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonce-wore-tiffany-amp-co-s-most-expensive-diamond-necklace>Beyonce Wore Tiffany & Co.’s Most Expensive Diamond Necklace</h2><p>While hosting an Oscar’s afterparty at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, <a href=#>Beyonce shimmered in the most expensive diamond necklace</a> ever created by Tiffany & Co.</p><p>Known as the Historic 1939 World's Fair Necklace, the piece features an 80-carat Empire Diamond. <a href=#>It’s worth over $30 million</a>.</p><p>Needless to say, Beyonce has a taste for the finer things in life, especially when it comes to clothing and jewelry. And apparently, her eldest child, Blue Ivy, is taking after her, <a href=#>as the 11-year-old has also worn some equally bougie outfits</a>. We guess it runs in the family!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Beyoncé’s Daughter Blue Ivy Bid For Pair Of Diamond And Earrings For $80,000 At An Auction</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>WWD</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>WIO News</a>, <a href=#>Billboard</a>, <a href=#>Vogue</a>, <a href=#>Time</a>, <a href=#>E!
