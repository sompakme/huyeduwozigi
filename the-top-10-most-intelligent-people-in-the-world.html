They know it all and we mean that not in the negative sense of the term. They are some of the smartest people in the world and they have the IQ scores to back it up. They can answer probably anything from simple arithmetic to the most complicated rocket science question. Here is a list of the top 10 most intelligent people in the world.</p><h2 id=10-james-woods-180-iq><b>10. James Woods – 180 IQ</b></h2><p><a title="James Woods Net Worth" href=#>James Woods</a> is a movie, television and stage actor. He has won two Emmy Awards for his performances in “Promise” and “My Name is Bill W” and has been nominated twice for the Academy Awards. He also played the lead role in the television series entitled “Shark.” Aside from acting, Woods is also some sort of math whiz, having studied linear algebra in UCLA while he was still in high school. He was also a full scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before the acting bug hit him.</p><h2 id=9-marilyn-vos-savant-190-iq><b>9.

Kenneth Ferrell – 190 IQ</b></h2><p>Kenneth Ferrell is a North Carolina-based doctor who is a member of a number of elite IQ organizations, like the GenerIQ Society, Epimethius Society and the Order of Imhotep.

Garry Kasparov – 190 IQ</b></h2><p>He is a chess grandmaster from Russia who became the youngest undisputed world champion when he was 22 years old. He beat the then-champion Anatoly Karpov after a grueling duel in 1985. Kasparov held the official world title recognized by the international chess federation until 1993. A dispute occurred, however, forcing Kasparov to relinquish the crown and to form instead the rival Professional Chess Association. In 1997, he lost a chess match to Deep Blue, the first time a world champion had lost to a computer under standard time controls. Kasparov was recognized as the “classical” world champion until 2000, when he as defeated by Vladimir Kramnik. Still, he holds the record for the longest reign at number one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2 id=6-mislav-predavec-192-iq><b>6.

Rick Rosner – 192 IQ</b></h2><p>By simply looking at his resume’, Rick Rosner would not be thought of as one of the most intelligent people in the world. He has a rough and tough demeanor, having spent a number of years as a bar bouncer. He has also worked as one of those waiters who go around in roller skates. In addition, Rosner has no qualms showing off his body, having been a stripper and nude model in the past. What sets him apart is his 192 IQ. He has put it to good use by joining the television game show called “Who Wants to be a Millionaire?” And he does not want to rest on his laurels, as he spends up to 20 hours a day completing IQ exams in a bid to get further up this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-dr-evangelos-katsioulis-198-iq><b>4.

NASA then invited him to study in the U.S. when he was eight. By the time he was a teenager, he was already working for them. He then returned to Korea and switched fields from physics to civil engineering. He then published 90 papers about hydraulics.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2 id=2-christopher-hirata-225-iq><b>2. Christopher Hirata – 225 IQ</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the age of 13, Christopher Hirata made waves by getting a gold medal at the international physics Olympiad.
