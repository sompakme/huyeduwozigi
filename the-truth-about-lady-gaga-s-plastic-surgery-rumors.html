She burst onto the scene in 2008, with her unique brand of dance-pop and avant-garde fashion sense. <a href=#>Gaga's star power grew with the release of each new album</a> and video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she became more famous, Gaga began to develop a deeper relationship to her fans, whom she dubbed "little monsters." Her message became one of self-acceptance and personal empowerment. This was especially evident on her 2011 hit "Born This Way."</p><p>Despite this message, many believe Gaga has gone under the knife to change how she was born. Gaga has denied getting plastic surgery. What she has admitted to getting, however, has led to many calling her hypocritical given her message of personal acceptance.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-became-famous-and-used-her-platform-to-preach-self-acceptance>Lady Gaga Became Famous And Used Her Platform To Preach Self-Acceptance</h2><p>Lady Gaga's first album "The Fame" was released in 2008. The first single "Just Dance" became a huge hit. However, it didn't happen instantly. According to Gaga, <a href=#>it was a real battle to get the song played on the radio</a>, because it was a dance song. At the time, dance music wasn't as popular, and it was especially risky if you were a new artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fight paid off in the end, because Gaga's career took off. Her second single, "Poker Face," sealed the deal. She was now becoming one of the new superstars of her generation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar48735337.jpg><p>Her next project initially started as a deluxe version of her debut. However, it grew into an EP titled "The Fame Monster." Gaga said the project was about her fears and the anxieties she experienced on the road. She said that each song represented a different "monster" in her life. The effort spawned the hit single "Bad Romance," which remains one of Gaga's most successful singles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, Gaga embarked on "The Monster Ball Tour," which took her around the world until 2011. During the shows, Gaga preached a message of self-acceptance and empowerment to her millions of fans, whom she affectionately called "little monsters."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/C37502C0-78C9-4EFE-8CB0-6417397EB9A7.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened Between Barbra Streisand And Lady Gaga?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Barbra Streisand didn't seem too keen on Lady Gaga's remake of "A Star Is Born."</span><p>Her second studio album was released in 2011. Titled "Born This Way," the message of the album was about self-acceptance and celebrating individuality. It spoke to Gaga's young fan base, most of whom were LGBTQ. Gaga positioned herself as an advocate for equality and championed anti-bullying causes.</p><h2 id=39-born-this-way-39-helped-gaga-become-a-role-model-to-her-fans-and-was-praised-by-elton-john>'Born This Way' Helped Gaga Become A Role Model To Her Fans And Was Praised By Elton John</h2><p>When Gaga released the single "Born This Way" in 2011, she was subjected to a tidal wave of media headlines. Very few had to do with the song's subject and everything to do with its similarities to Madonna's "Express Yourself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song itself had an inclusive message that spoke to many within the LGBTQ+ community. Its theme of self-love and self-acceptance was liberating for much of the young audience who considered Gaga a role model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar47692950.jpg><p><a href=#>Elton John spoke to Entertainment Weekly</a> during this time and shared his thoughts on the song.</p><p>"She and I come from exactly the same place," John said. "She's kind of like the bastard daughter of Elton John. I love her, and I love her ability to write. There’s a chance I might do one track with her, but she’s so busy and I’m so busy, we can never get together! But her record – it’s f****** amazing. ‘Born This Way’, which is the title song, will completely get rid of Gloria Gaynor’s 'I Will Survive.' This is the new 'I Will Survive.' That was the gay anthem. This is the new gay anthem. Actually, it’s not a gay anthem – it can apply to anybody."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/what-happened-between-lady-gaga-and-elton-john_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened Between Lady Gaga And Elton John?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Elton John and Lady Gaga are so close, he named her the godmother of his children.</span><p>The song would become a huge hit for Gaga and even become one of her signature tunes. Gaga took the song's message even further and founded the Born This Way Foundation with her mother Cynthia that same year. The foundation is focused on youth empowerment and mental health.</p><p>"I think she’s a great role model, she’s young, I admire everything about her, she’s been a great godmother so far to Zachary," <a href=#>John told Extra in 2013</a>.

"I think that promoting insecurity in the form of plastic surgery is infinitely more harmful than an artistic expression related to body modification."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also said, "I am an artist, and I have the ability and the free will to choose the way the world will envision me."</p><p>Those plastic surgery rumors would continue, however, with the biggest one being that Gaga had undergone a rhinoplasty.</p><p>"No," Gaga said when asked if she got a nose job. "I love my Italian nose."</p><p>However, Gaga has admitted to getting fillers. During a 2013 interview with Howard Stern, she admitted to getting Juvederm, a dermal filler for cheeks, lips and the areas around the mouth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I would smoke a bunch of joints and have some drinks and I would be like, ‘Oh, let’s go see my girl’ and we would drive to this strip mall and I would get shot up with a bunch of whatever, Juvederm, and then leave," she admitted.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lady-gaga-david-letterman.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lady Gaga Wasn't Happy With David Letterman's Questions And Shocked The Host With Her Reaction</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lady Gaga made an infamous appearance on David Letterman's show which shocked even the host himself.</span><p>Many believed this was hypocritical of Gaga, who always preached a self-acceptance message to her little monsters.</p><p>Apparently, Gaga's use of fillers got so excessive, a friend of hers said, "Gaga, I love you but if you don’t stop injecting s*** in your face..."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6ra3DsmSgmZeWwG68y5qqraGTYsC2vsaeqbJloqq6sL7SaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Lady%20Gaga%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Rumors&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Lady%20Gaga%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Lady%20Gaga%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Lady%20Gaga%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Lady%20Gaga%27s%20Plastic%20Surgery%20Rumors" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Comedian Gabriel Iglesias Keeps His Relationships Private">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-traitors-season-premiere-recap-bravo-babes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Traitors Season-Premiere Recap: Bravo Babes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
