With a clever mind, Parton asked all of the seventh- and eighth-grade students to have a buddy and announced that she will be donating $500 in cash for each student once they were able to finish high successfully. To be given $500 each, they had only one requirement that is to make sure that their buddy will graduate and finish high school successfully. With Parton’s helping hand, the dropout rate in the said school declined significantly from 35% down to 6%. There was no reported head count of the number of students that were helped by the program but with an estimated student of 1,000, the program would have costs around $500,000.</p><h2 id=her-donation-to-sevier-county-hospital>Her Donation To Sevier County Hospital</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dolly Parton held a benefit concert to help raise money for the LeConte Medical Center, the latest hospital and cancer center in the county at the time.
