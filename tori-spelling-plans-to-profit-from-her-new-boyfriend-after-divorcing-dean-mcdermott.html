Over time, however, that began to change as her career began to focus on the reality shows Spelling has headlined.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In many cases, Spelling's reality shows focused on her relationship with her ex, Dean McDermott, and their kids. According to an April 2024 Daily Mail report, an insider told the outlet that Spelling was open to starring in a reality show again that is mostly about her. In this case, Spelling would be happy to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>consider starring in a dating reality show</strong></a>.</p><p>"Whether it is organic or if she is put on a blind date, Tori wants to find love again.

Most notably, shows from the Bachelor Nation franchise have become a huge deal. On top of that, dating shows are huge on Netflix, including Love is Blind, The Ultimatum, Too Hot to Handle, Love on the Spectrum, and many more.</p><p>In theory, it is easy to imagine Spelling joining some of those shows as a form of stunt casting. Failing that, Spelling easily could be the main star of a reality show solely focused on her search for a new love. After all, Brett Michaels and Flavor Flav spent years doing that.</p><p>In either scenario, Spelling could make a lot of money from bringing her attempts at dating to television.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_how-kevin-costner-s-relationship-with-his-son-hayes-changed-since-his-divorce-from-christine-baumgartner_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Kevin Costner's Relationship With His Son, Hayes Changed Since His Divorce From Christine Baumgartner">How Kevin Costner's Relationship With His Son, Hayes Changed Since His Divorce From Christine Baumgartner</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner had a bitter divorce, fans are curious if he has a good relationship with his son Hayes Costner.</p><p>Daily Mail's article about Spelling's willingness to star in a new reality show also revealed what she is thinking about dating in the future.

Days later, McDermott and Calo were spotted kissing as they were at the Los Angeles International Airport.</p><p>Since the media first spotted Calo, fans have learned that she is a successful professional who has lived in multiple states.

"I like Lily a lot. It's not bad. It's just you know, it's different."
