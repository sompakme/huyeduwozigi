I can stay.’”</p><p>DeVitto and Wesley, 41, tied the knot in 2011 after meeting on the set of Killer Movie in 2007. Once they were married, DeVitto joined the cast of <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a>, playing Dr. Meredith Fell from 2012 to 2013.</p><p>Her exit from the series coincided with their divorce, <a href=#>which was finalized in 2013</a>. Looking back at her departure, DeVitto recalled thinking, “I don’t want to come back. I’m good, thank you.”</p><p>Wesley, meanwhile, remained on the series as Stefan Salvatore until it ended in 2017 after eight seasons. DeVitto noted that <a href=#>Wesley’s fame on TVD</a> made it hard for her to heal from their public split.</p><p>“That did garner a bit of attention I don’t think I was prepared for,” she told podcast hosts <strong>Rachel Bilson</strong> and <strong>Olivia Allen</strong>. “Then it was hard, too, because for a couple of years, anyone I would date afterwards, people would just [say], ‘He’s so disgusting. He’ll never be him.’ Then they’d find that person’s mom’s page. … Mortifying.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Chicago Med</a> alum confessed that getting married at 26 years old and divorced a few years later was “confusing” and “so emotional.”</p><p>DeVitto revealed, “I cried through my 20s. I was angsty, I was confused.” She later explained that the divorce was a “really dark time for me” because she was also experiencing a “friendship breakup.”</p><p>The actress explained that although she was a public figure, she was good at keeping her feelings bottled up. “When I got divorced, nobody knew anything was going on because I hid everything. So it was like, ‘Oh, my God,’” she recalled. “A lot of people didn’t understand me in that moment. It was an interesting time for sure. You grow from it.”</p><p>DeVitto previously revealed that she and Wesley are on good terms despite going their separate ways.</p><p>“It was really for the best. He’s lovely — we shouldn’t have gotten married. We were really young when we met,” she confessed during a May episode of the <a href=#>“Pretty Little Liars: True Crime” podcast</a>. “We were 22 and we were crazy. Two insane people getting married. We were young and wild.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/torrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.jpg><p>DeVitto added, “Once I knew that it was time to go, I always wanted the best for him. I still want the best for him. I actually bump into him here and there. It’s been so long.”</p><p>Soon after their divorce, <a href=#>Wesley began dating</a> his Vampire Diaries costar <strong>Phoebe Tonkin</strong>, but the pair split in 2017. The actor married <strong>Ines de Ramon</strong> in 2019. Three years later, Us Weekly confirmed that Wesley and de Ramon, 31, separated. De Ramon has since moved on with <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>.</p><p>Wesley, meanwhile, has been dating <a href=#>model <strong>Natalie Kuckenburg</strong></a> since late 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>DeVitto has also found love again with fiancé <strong>Jared LaPine</strong>. Us broke the news in September 2023 that <a href=#>the couple got engaged</a> on the actress’ farm in Michigan over Labor Day weekend.</p><p>Earlier this year, DeVitto announced that <a href=#>she is pregnant</a> with her and LaPine’s first baby, a little girl, who is due in November.</p><p>Although it took her a while to find her happily ever after, DeVitto knew LaPine was The One early on. “I actually told my fiancé I loved him first. I had never done that before,” DeVitto said on Monday. “I felt it so much, so I just blurt it, like, a month [into dating]. We got engaged, too, so quick.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuoqqKaxm6wxK%2BgrayfYsSiv4ydpqedXay2tbSMr5imqJmnsm6wyJqpop2jYq6nwMSrZKmZpaF6uLHSpZyyZZSew7C%2Bwp5m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftorrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.html&text=Torrey%20DeVitto%20Was%20Done%20With%20Vampire%20Diaries%20After%20Paul%20Wesley%20Divorce&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftorrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftorrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.html&title=Torrey%20DeVitto%20Was%20Done%20With%20Vampire%20Diaries%20After%20Paul%20Wesley%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftorrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.html&title=Torrey%20DeVitto%20Was%20Done%20With%20Vampire%20Diaries%20After%20Paul%20Wesley%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftorrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.html&title=Torrey%20DeVitto%20Was%20Done%20With%20Vampire%20Diaries%20After%20Paul%20Wesley%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftorrey-devitto-was-done-with-vampire-diaries-after-paul-wesley-divorce.html&description=Torrey%20DeVitto%20Was%20Done%20With%20Vampire%20Diaries%20After%20Paul%20Wesley%20Divorce" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Andrew Garfield After His 'Spider-Man' Trilogy?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./terra-jole-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Terra Jole Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
