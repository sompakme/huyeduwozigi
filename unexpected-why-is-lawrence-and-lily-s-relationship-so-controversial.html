One couple that is rather controversial among the show's fans is Lily and Lawrence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think Certain Parts Of TLC's Unexpected Might Be Scripted</a></span></p><p>Lawrence and Lily got together after things did not work out with Lily's first baby-daddy, James, who fans got to know in the <a href=#>first season</a>. Many argue that Lawrence and Lily do not have a good relationship and that Lawrence's behavior is just a series of red flags. The two now have a child together in addition to Lily's firstborn, but is the family toxic? Why is Lily and Lawrence's relationship so controversial?</p><h2 id=is-lawrence-better-than-james><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Is Lawrence Better Than James?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Kennedy learned Lily was pregnant when he was only 17 and she was 16. Throughout Lily's pregnancy, he demonstrated a major lack of interest. He was not eager to go with Lily to birthing classes, he thought because he came from a large family that he already knew everything there is to know about childbirth. He also broke his promise that he would one day marry Lily. Also, when Lily made it clear that she wanted more kids, James came across to fans as <a href=#>cold and distant towards the idea</a>. Lawrence has shown more interest in fatherhood than James did, but does that mean he is stepping up?</p><h2 id=they-fight-a-lot><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Fight A Lot</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that concerns fans is <a href=#>how much the pair fights</a>. Fights and drama are indeed a cornerstone of any reality show, but Lily and Lawrence seem to fight over some of the most trivial things. They fought about packing when they first moved in together and about their moving plans. Many are also not into how Lawrence talks to Lily, some say he escalates arguments too quickly and that he does not value Lily enough as a mother.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened In The Feud Between TLC's 'Unexpected' And MTV's 'Teen Mom'?</a></span></p><h2 id=lawrence-can-be-kind-of-a-jerk><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lawrence Can Be Kind Of A Jerk</span></h2><p>Lawrence can also come across as pretty abrasive and stand-offish. In addition to being "dismissive" to Lily as a Mom (according to SoapDish) some think he values his work to pay the bills more than he values what Lily does for their kids. Lawrence also maintains that as the man of the house he does not need to listen to Lily. In one episode, after returning from work, he starts an argument about how he is not happy that <a href=#>Lily did not clean the house for him</a>, even though she was busy dealing with the children all day. In many ways this is an outdated, and some would say sexist, approach to marriage. Lawrence, it's not 1960 and you are not Don Draper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-were-not-okay-with-what-he-wanted-to-do-to-baby-lj><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Fans Were Not Okay With What He Wanted To Do To Baby LJ</span></h2><p>Another point of controversy with fans was the episode when he and Lily fought about Baby LJ's body. Lawrence insisted that LJ get circumcised, and Lily at first refused, but the pair eventually went ahead with the procedure. Circumcision has become a controversial topic, while some argue in favor of it either for health or religious reasons, others maintain it is outdated, cruel, and is a form of genital mutilation. The controversy only grew when doctors revealed that <a href=#>LJ's circumcision was botched</a>.</p><h2 id=lawrence-ignored-her-labor-pains><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lawrence Ignored Her Labor Pains</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lawrence also upset fans during the storyline of LJ's birth. When Lily began to have labor pains, <a href=#>Lawrence was dismissive</a>. He told her to toughen up, that he wanted to continue sleeping, and when Lily did finally go to the hospital he was reluctant to go with her.</p><h2 id=fans-think-lawrence-failed-to-step-up-in-an-important-moment><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fans Think Lawrence Failed To Step Up In An Important Moment</span></h2><p>Many fans feel that Lawrence should not be forgiven for being so reluctant to go with Lily to the hospital. Many also believe that a father has a duty to be there for the mother and a duty to be present for the birth of their children. In addition to all of this, some fans also think he was not supportive or understanding enough as Lily was giving birth. Lawrence maintains that he was hesitant because he was worried there was little he could do to help Lily while she gave birth. Others believe that the fact she wanted him there at the hospital with her should have been enough. She was the one in labor after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Fans Want To Know About TLC's Shauna Rae</a></span></p><h2 id=some-argue-these-are-all-huge-red-flags><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Some Argue These Are All Huge Red Flags</span></h2><p>All of this combined has left fans with unsettling feelings about Lawrence. True, he did step up to be in a relationship with Lily and build a future with her, but that does not necessarily make him a good spouse or father. His lack of understanding, his impatience, and his stubbornness have many arguing that the couple should not be together and that Lawrence needs to go.</p><h2 id=are-they-still-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Are They Still Together?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Short answer, yes. Long answer, yes but not much is known about the status of their relationship other than what they have shared on the show. They are still living together, still raising their children together, but whether or not they are in a happy relationship or if the couple ever got counseling remains unknown. Fans are likely to keep tabs on this pair for a while. Will Lily ever kick Lawrence to the curb? Will Lawrence ever get his act together? Will Lily's children grow up with the kind of father they deserve? Some fans say yes, others say heck no. Either way, there is a lot of material for Unexpected episodes thanks to Lily and Lawrence.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Joy Anna Duggar Is Distancing Herself From Her Family</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBuuMCwqZ6mk5p6rbXLsmSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdmLyvwNGorZ6qo56urXnUp5yxqJWYwaawjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2funexpected-why-is-lawrence-and-lily-s-relationship-so-controversial.html&text=Unexpected%3a%20Why%20Is%20Lawrence%20And%20Lily%27s%20Relationship%20So%20Controversial%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2funexpected-why-is-lawrence-and-lily-s-relationship-so-controversial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2funexpected-why-is-lawrence-and-lily-s-relationship-so-controversial.html&title=Unexpected%3a%20Why%20Is%20Lawrence%20And%20Lily%27s%20Relationship%20So%20Controversial%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2funexpected-why-is-lawrence-and-lily-s-relationship-so-controversial.html&title=Unexpected%3a%20Why%20Is%20Lawrence%20And%20Lily%27s%20Relationship%20So%20Controversial%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2funexpected-why-is-lawrence-and-lily-s-relationship-so-controversial.html&title=Unexpected%3a%20Why%20Is%20Lawrence%20And%20Lily%27s%20Relationship%20So%20Controversial%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2funexpected-why-is-lawrence-and-lily-s-relationship-so-controversial.html&description=Unexpected%3a%20Why%20Is%20Lawrence%20And%20Lily%27s%20Relationship%20So%20Controversial%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-taylor-swift-s-ttpd-song-cassandra-about-lyrics-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Taylor Swift's 'TTPD' Song 'Cassandra' About?
