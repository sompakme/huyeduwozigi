According to HollywoodLife, Ray was married to Kanye’s mother Donda before they divorced in 1980. Ray has been a part of Kanye’s life since he was born, although once Kanye became famous, Ray took more of a backseat role in his son's life.</p><p>Kanye attempted to connect with his dad a few years ago. They bonded while filming Kanye's music video "Follow God". Since then, many fans have been more curious about an important yet unknown person in the "Famous" rapper's life.</p><p>Here's everything to know about their relationship, including what Ray thinks about some of Kanye's crazier controversies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-kanye-39-s-father-ray-west>Who Is Kanye's Father Ray West?</h2><p>According to Newsweek, Ray West was born on November 29, 1925, in Detroit, Michigan.

Ray married Kanye’s mother Donda and they welcomed Kanye into the world on June 8, 1977. When Ray and Donda West divorced in 1980, Kanye moved to Chicago but spent summers with his father in Washington DC.</p><p>Many people may know about Donda because of Kanye's 2021 album dedicated to her. That album was the precursor to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beefs with A-list celebrities such as Drake, Pete Davidson, and even Kid Cudi</a>, so it's certainly made its place in history even without considering the music side of things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kanye-West-Threatens-Pete-Davidson-On-New-Donda-2-Song.jpg><p>Donda was already famous for her influence on her son's life, and his public declarations for her.

She was an academic professor and the mother of rapper Kanye West. She taught at Chicago State University before retiring to manage her son’s career in the 2000s. She was her son's manager until her death in 2007</p><p>There really isn't much known about Donda and Ray's particular relationship. Considering that both had careers revolving around writing and language, there's a strong likelihood that's how they initially met and bonded.
