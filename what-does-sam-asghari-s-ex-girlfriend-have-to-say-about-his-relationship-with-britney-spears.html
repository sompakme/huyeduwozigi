Among those that have shared their opinions of this relationship, is none other than Sam Asghari's ex-girlfriend, Mayra Verónica. Mayra was romantically linked to Sam Asghari before he met <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has recently opened up to the press to dish all the dirt about Sam Asghari and how she feels about the fact that he has just committed is future to Britney, and as it turns out, there really isn't any dirt to dish at all. She was asked to share her thoughts about the couples' relationship, and according to Us Weekly, she <a href=#>had a whole lot to share with her fans</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most of it was incredibly positive.</a> Here's what Sam's ex has to say about the future he is about to embark on...</p><h2 id=sam-39-hit-the-jackpot-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sam 'Hit The Jackpot'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mayra began her discussion about Sam and Britney's relationship by boldly declaring that Sam Asghari has "hit the jackpot" with Britney Spears. Almost immediately, fans correlated this to be a direct reference to discussions of a prenup that had taken over the headlines in recent days, but she was quick to clarify that she was not referencing money at all. The Blast indicates that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Mayra has a lot of respect for Britney Spears,</a> and that she holds her in high esteem.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Sam Asghari Has Said About His Relationship With Britney Spears</a></span></p><h2 id=wait-britney-hit-the-jackpot-too><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Wait, Britney Hit The Jackpot, Too</span></h2><p>Just to be sure that fans didn't get the wrong idea about the "jackpot" comment, as quickly as she uttered that line about Sam, she also shot out the same information about Britney, saying that Spears has "hit the jackpot too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shifting the focus from finances to personality traits, Mayra clarified that she thinks they are both incredible people and that presumes this to be the final relationship that either of them embarks on. She went on to say that she feels Britney has also hit the jackpot, and she continued by writing a series of very kind comments about Sam's incredible heart and generous, genuine character.</p><h2 id=sam-39-s-ex-girlfriend-is-very-happy-for-them><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sam's Ex-Girlfriend Is Very Happy For Them</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as jealous exes go, it doesn't appear that Mayra Verónica has a jealous bone in her body when she thinks about her ex-boyfriend and Britney Spears being together. She seems completely at ease with the fact that she and Sam had broken up, and she went so far so to say that she is truly and honestly happy for the lovebirds. She mentioned that she wished them well a number of times during her interviews with the press and seems to be in favor of Sam Asghari and Britney Spears seeking to grow their lives together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Grow Suspicious Of Sam Asghari As Britney Spears Disappears From Social Media</a></span></p><h2 id=britney-spears-is-with-the-39-right-guy-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Britney Spears Is With The 'Right Guy'</span></h2><p>One of the most memorable things that Mayra said when she was asked about what she thought of Britney and Sam's union, she went on to say that she really feels Sam is well-suited for Britney in every way. She went on to say, "He was always super, super supportive, so I think <a href=#>she’s with the right guy.</a>” Having her blessing may not carry a lot of weight to the lovebirds, but the mere fact that Mayra is supportive of this union, speaks volumes about how well-suited for one another they truly are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mayra-ver-oacute-nica-hopes-they-last-forever><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mayra Verónica Hopes They Last Forever</span></h2><p>Mayra Verónica is really full of love and support for Britney Spears and Sam Asghari, and she is very happy to see them take this next step towards spending the rest of their lives together. She has gone on to publicly wish them both a lifetime full of happiness together, and she is rooting for them to go the long haul. Despite the fact that Hollywood marriages don't exactly have the best odds of working out, Mayra thinks that Sam and Britney really do have what it takes to last forever.</p><h2 id=sam-asghari-is-really-as-charming-as-he-seems><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sam Asghari Is Really As Charming As He Seems</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard for fans to know what their favorite stars are actually like behind the scenes, but Mayra can confirm that when it comes to Sam Asghari, he is truly the real deal. She went on to say that she can validate the fact that Sam Asghari is really as nice as he appears on social media. It's not all a facade in any way, he is just a very kind, considerate, supportive person, and she has experienced this first-hand. Mayra made it clear that Sam is a very kind, gentle man that is really as charming in person as he seems to be while in front of the cameras.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Says Her Engagement To Sam Asghari Was ‘Way Overdue’</a></span></p><h2 id=britney-39-needs-this-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Britney 'Needs This'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Mayra has a whole lot of confidence in Sam Asghari. She is aware of the fact that Britney Spears has really gone through a very difficult time over the past several years, and upon hearing of their engagement, Mayra told the press that she thinks "Britney needs this," alluding to the fact that Sam is her saving grace. Mayra agrees that having a wedding to plan and look forward to, alongside Sam who clearly loves her so much, is exactly what Britney Spears needs in her life right now.</p><h2 id=sam-has-good-intentions><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sam Has Good Intentions</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For all the naysayers out there, Sam Asghari's ex has just spoken up to reveal that he is a really good man that has nothing but pure love for Britney Spears. Many guests are accusing Sam of taking advantage of Britney Spears and her fortune and say he is being opportunistic with this proposal; Mayra confirms that this just couldn't be further from the truth. She reminds fans that Sam has good intentions with Britney and would never harm her or take advantage of her.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Britney Spears Fans Say She's 'Not Well' And Her Fiancé 'Knows It</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmqpqlXZbAqLTAq6CsZZWttKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqprdWeZK2nXaiuunnAm6aurF2dtrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16o77IraWesV2ovaat0axkppmpp65uwsSrpqehk5Z8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-sam-asghari-s-ex-girlfriend-have-to-say-about-his-relationship-with-britney-spears.html&text=What%20Does%20Sam%20Asghari%27s%20Ex-Girlfriend%20Have%20To%20Say%20About%20His%20Relationship%20With%20Britney%20Spears%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-sam-asghari-s-ex-girlfriend-have-to-say-about-his-relationship-with-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-sam-asghari-s-ex-girlfriend-have-to-say-about-his-relationship-with-britney-spears.html&title=What%20Does%20Sam%20Asghari%27s%20Ex-Girlfriend%20Have%20To%20Say%20About%20His%20Relationship%20With%20Britney%20Spears%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-sam-asghari-s-ex-girlfriend-have-to-say-about-his-relationship-with-britney-spears.html&title=What%20Does%20Sam%20Asghari%27s%20Ex-Girlfriend%20Have%20To%20Say%20About%20His%20Relationship%20With%20Britney%20Spears%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-sam-asghari-s-ex-girlfriend-have-to-say-about-his-relationship-with-britney-spears.html&title=What%20Does%20Sam%20Asghari%27s%20Ex-Girlfriend%20Have%20To%20Say%20About%20His%20Relationship%20With%20Britney%20Spears%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-sam-asghari-s-ex-girlfriend-have-to-say-about-his-relationship-with-britney-spears.html&description=What%20Does%20Sam%20Asghari%27s%20Ex-Girlfriend%20Have%20To%20Say%20About%20His%20Relationship%20With%20Britney%20Spears%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-cory-binney-dating-cory-binney-girlfriend-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Cory Binney dating?
