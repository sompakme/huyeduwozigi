Back then, Sony was determined to reboot its massively successful Spider-Man trilogy with Tobey Maguire. Unfortunately, however, things didn’t exactly go according to plan. For starters, the two Amazing Spider-Man movies didn’t do as well as expected (especially The Amazing Spider-Man 2). At the same time, <a href=#>it’s been rumored that Sony fired Garfield</a> after failing to show to an event in Brazil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Andrew Garfield Initially Thought After Watching 'The Social Network'</a></span></p><p>Since then, Garfield has moved on from playing Spider-Man. And although he did make a surprise appearance in the MCU’s Spider-Man: No Way Home, the actor has been busy making his mark in various non-superhero projects. Even more impressive, Garfield has also received two Oscar nods so far.</p><h2 id=andrew-garfield-earned-an-oscar-after-spider-man>Andrew Garfield Earned An Oscar After Spider Man</h2><p><a href=#>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 may have been underwhelming at the box office</a> (it didn’t fare well with critics either), but it didn’t really matter. Around this time, it seemed Garfield was just ready to move on, and the right film was just around the corner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film is none other than Hacksaw Bridge, the 2016 biopic which tells the real-life story of World War II American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, the first man to be awarded the Medal of Honor without having to fire a single shot. Directed by Mel Gibson, Garfield was tapped to play Doss himself. The actor/director may not be a fan of superhero films, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garfield’s performance as Eduardo Saverin</a> in the 2010 critical hit The Social Network.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Andrew Garfield Was Rejected For 'The Chronicles Of Narnia' Role</a></span></p><p>“He’s a guy who reaches for a profound level, and he has a huge amount of intelligence and a lot of heart, too,” Gibson told Backstage of Garfield. “That guy is made to be a great actor.” Meanwhile, aside from getting a thumbs-up approval from Doss’ family and friends, Garfield also earned his first best actor Oscar nod for his performance in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andrew-garfield-also-returned-to-theater>Andrew Garfield Also Returned To Theater</h2><p>Years after joining the cast of Death of a Salesman, Garfield returned to Broadway for the National Theatre Live’s theatrical production of Tony Kushner’s Angels in America. In the production, Garfield played Prior Walter, a young homosexual New Yorker who contracts AIDS.</p><p>Before taking on the role himself, Garfield was already more than familiar with Kushner’s masterpiece. Years before, HBO did a miniseries adaptation with Meryl Streep and Al Pacino. And so, when he approached to play Prior, Garfield’s answer was an immediate yes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I said yes because I remembered that body feeling I got from the film, and I knew it was important,” the actor told Out. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garfield would later win a Tony</a> for his performance in the production.</p><h2 id=later-on-andrew-garfield-joined-jessica-chastain-in-this-biopic>Later On, Andrew Garfield Joined Jessica Chastain In This Biopic</h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><p>A few years after winning his first Tony, Garfield joined the cast of The Eyes of Tammy Faye, starring alongside Chastain who plays the titular character. In the film, the actor played Faye’s husband, the televangelist Jim Bakker who later gets convicted of fraud.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Andrew Garfield's Most Profitable Movies (Besides The Amazing Spider-Man)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m definitely morbidly fascinated by the psyche of a person who can look down the barrel of a lens, live on TV, and say, ‘God will only love you if you give us your money,’” Garfield said of portraying the controversial figure. “Ultimately, he just misinterpreted the word ‘prosperity’ in the Bible, because from the original Greek, it meant spiritual prosperity, which, as we know, is kind of the antithesis of material prosperity.”</p><p>And while Chastain managed to speak with the real Faye while working on the film, Garfield never got a chance to speak with Bakker. “I never got to speak to Jim — I tried, and I was never met there by him, but that’s okay,” he told Observer. “His kids are wonderful and other people that we managed to track down were incredible.”</p><h2 id=andrew-garfield-wowed-critics-with-a-netflix-original-film>Andrew Garfield Wowed Critics With A Netflix Original Film</h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around the same time, Garfield also got to work on the Netflix film tick, tick…BOOM!, which also marks Lin-Manuel Miranda’s directorial debut. In the movie, the actor plays a young theater composer who is determined to deliver the next great American musical. The character is based on the late composer Jonathan Larson who is best known for his Broadway hit, Rent.</p><p>“He was someone who had acute awareness of the shortness and sacredness of our time here,” Garfield said of Larson during an interview with Deadline. “At his own sense of running out of time, he was someone that was a seer of life. He knew he didn’t have a moment to lose or deviate from his destiny.” The actor also earned his second Oscar nod for his performance in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Spider-Man: No Way Home and Tick, Tick…BOOM!, fans can look forward to seeing Garfield in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the upcoming FX limited series on Hulu Under the Banner of Heaven</a>. At the same time, the actor will also star in the upcoming BBC series Brideshead Revisited. Other stars reportedly attached to the project include Cate Blanchett, Ralph Fiennes, and Rooney Mara.</p><p>Meanwhile, those wondering whether Garfield will return to the MCU would just have to wait and see. For the record, however, the actor hasn’t ruled out becoming a web slinger one more time. “I would love to continue working with Tobey [Maguire] and with Tom [Holland],” Garfield told Variety. “That kind of three brother dynamic is so juicy.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Andrew Garfield Reveals One Of His Most Terrifying Experiences On Set</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZa7pb7EsGSgmaKbtqa4w2aYn6yVp3q0vMidnKtlnZa7bsDRoqOon6lk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Andrew%20Garfield%20After%20His%20%27Spider-Man%27%20Trilogy%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Andrew%20Garfield%20After%20His%20%27Spider-Man%27%20Trilogy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Andrew%20Garfield%20After%20His%20%27Spider-Man%27%20Trilogy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Andrew%20Garfield%20After%20His%20%27Spider-Man%27%20Trilogy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-andrew-garfield-after-his-spider-man-trilogy.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Andrew%20Garfield%20After%20His%20%27Spider-Man%27%20Trilogy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-sssaaraahhh-tiktok-sarah-hamilton-age-meet-her-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Sssaaraahhh TikTok?
