But we will detail below what Nathan Schwandt has been up to since his breakup with Jeffree Star. Is Schwandt dating someone again? How is he spending his time? Where is Jeffree Star's ex-boyfriend living today?</p><h2 id=nathan-schwandt-appears-to-now-be-dating-top-onlyfans-performer-dominique><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Nathan Schwandt Appears To Now Be Dating Top Onlyfans Performer Dominique</span></h2><p>Photos of Nathan Schwandt emerged on the Twitter account of model and Onlyfans performer Dominique, who goes by "Darn it Domi" online. Dominique posted semi-nude pictures with Schwandt and captioned them: "Happiest when I'm with you." She also posted a few days earlier on her Twitter account that she found her match in a Leo Sun, which is the Zodiac sign of Nathan, who was born in August. Dominique lives in Austin, Texas and considers herself to be of the 0.3 percent top performers on Onlyfans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nathan-returned-to-michigan-after-the-breakup><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nathan Returned To Michigan After The Breakup</span></h2><p>As shown on his Instagram account, Nathan is now living in Michigan. Since his breakup with Jeffree Star in early 2020, Schwandt left California and returned to the state where he was born. He resides today in Grand Rapids, the second-largest city in Michigan. Before the breakup, Nathan lived in Star's $16.4 Million mansion in the Hidden Hills in California. On the other hand, <a href=#>Jeffree Star listed in mid-2021 his mega-mansion for sale and declared that he is leaving California</a> and moving out to Wyoming for good.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Seth Rogen Now Sells Weed and Vinyl For All Your Musical Marijuana Needs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nathan-schwandt-started-showcasing-his-skateboarding-hobby><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nathan Schwandt Started Showcasing His Skateboarding Hobby</span></h2><p>Schwandt occasionally posts videos and photos on his social media accounts performing his favorite hobby, skateboarding. He seemed to be enjoying the sport after the breakup when he was still in California, where he posted a video on his skateboard near the Walt Disney concert hall.</p><p>After moving to Grand Rapids, Michigan, Nathan continued to showcase his skateboarding on social media. In March 2020, Schwandt posted a photo where he was rock climbing a wall in Michigan. He captioned it, "Might have found a new hobby." During that time, <a href=#>new facts related to Jeffree Star's relationship with Nathan were still unfolding.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=schwandt-cozied-up-with-weed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Schwandt Cozied Up With Weed</span></h2><p>Nathan has been smoking weed since 1999. Moreover, since Michigan legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2018, Schwandt has been revealing his love for the plant. Actually, Nathan was spotted several times after his breakup with Star partaking in the drug. Some fans were speculating whether Schwandt is considering starting a new weed business or if he is just enjoying it for fun.</p><h2 id=nathan-walked-away-with-an-attractive-new-style><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nathan Walked Away With An Attractive New Style</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before dating Jeffree Star, Nathan worked as a pet shop employee in Michigan. He was an ordinary boy from Midwest USA. However, after meeting and dating Jeffree Star, <a href=#>Nathan transformed his looks</a>, started wearing luxury brands, dying his hair in fancy colors such as blue and green, taking care of his skin, and took his overall style to another level. It's worth saying that even after the breakup, Nathan maintained his unique and trendy style.</p><h2 id=nathan-schwandt-is-streaming-on-twitch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nathan Schwandt Is Streaming On Twitch</span></h2><p>Nathan recently began video-streaming on Twitch from time to time.

As Jeffree explained back then, Schwandt wanted to "detach" from this social world. Moreover, Nathan and Jeffree liked to DM people on social media for fun. As a result, fans would screenshot all of their conversations, circulate them and make a big story about them, which annoyed Nathan and pushed him to deactivate his Instagram and Snapchat accounts.</p><p>However, after the breakup, Nathan joined Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social media channels again. He now has more than 340,000 Instagram followers.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think Justin Bieber Is Over-Spending His $285 Million Net Worth, Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYruiwMeapWark53EorrDrWShmaNir6axzWasqWWkpHq0tc2cnGagmah6o77EmqKuqF2strW0jKOcn56imrJuv9OaqWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html&text=What%20Nathan%20Schwandt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20His%20Breakup%20With%20Jeffree%20Star&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html&title=What%20Nathan%20Schwandt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20His%20Breakup%20With%20Jeffree%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html&title=What%20Nathan%20Schwandt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20His%20Breakup%20With%20Jeffree%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html&title=What%20Nathan%20Schwandt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20His%20Breakup%20With%20Jeffree%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-nathan-schwandt-has-been-up-to-since-his-breakup-with-jeffree-star.html&description=What%20Nathan%20Schwandt%20Has%20Been%20Up%20To%20Since%20His%20Breakup%20With%20Jeffree%20Star" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./woody-mcclain-sister-mercedes-mcclain-and-family-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woody Mcclain Sister Mercedes Mcclain and Family Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ranking-the-top-30-finishing-moves-in-wwe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ranking The Top 30 Finishing Moves In WWE">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
