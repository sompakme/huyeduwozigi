Richard Belzer first appeared as the detective in 1993 on Homicide: Life on the Street. He and the character moved over to Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 1999. He remained on the show until saying his goodbye in 2013. <a href=#>Many other actors have also left Law & Order after being on the show for long periods of time</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before leaving, however, Belzer portrayed the famous character of John Munch in many other television shows. Belzer made appearances in Law & Order, The X-Files, The Beat, Law & Order: Trial by Jury, Arrested Development, The Wire and 30 Rock. He also appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt as Munch. Belzer is the only actor to appear in 11 different television shows as the same character, and he at one time held the record for live-action consecutive seasons as one character.</p><h2 id=richard-belzer-did-voice-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Richard Belzer Did Voice Acting</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/richard-belzer-on-homicide-life-on-the-streets.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richard Belzer did not do a lot of acting after exiting Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Though he did not formally retire from acting until late 2016, he chose to take long breaks in between roles since he had never had that opportunity while playing detective John Munch. The actor also chose to take on more laid-back roles. He chose to do voice acting, which many actors nowadays have been dabbling in.</p><p>Belzer previously had worked as a voice actor. He played Loogie in one episode of South Park in 2000. He returned to voice acting in 2016 in the animated show American Dad!

In real life, however, Belzer was a big conspiracy theorist. The actor believed very strongly that there was a conspiracy behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and he wrote five books about his beliefs.</p><p>Belzer’s first book, UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Believe, was published in 2000. He then proceeded to publish more books about the conspiracy, including Dead Wrong: Straight Facts on the Country's Most Controversial Cover-Ups, Hit List: An In-Depth Investigation into the Mysterious Deaths of Witnesses to the JFK Assassination, and Corporate Conspiracies: How Wall Street Took Over Washington. His final book, Someone Is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?, was published in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-richard-belzer-returned-to-law-amp-order><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>When Richard Belzer Returned To Law & Order</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/LawAndOrder1.jpg><p>Though Richard Belzer left Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 2013, his formal goodbye to the character did not come until 2016.

Fans of the hit show loved to see Belzer return to the character, and the reviews for the episode were very positive. Fans were particularly glad that the other characters did not make a big deal about his return.

The film starred Robert De Niro, Leslie Mann, and Danny DeVito. The movie tells the story of a comic icon attempting to reinvent himself after always being known for a role he played early in his career.
