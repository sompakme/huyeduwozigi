One year later, Wade dropped her first single as a solo artist titled ‚ÄúThe Night‚Äù and released her first full-length album, Reckless, in March 2021.</p><p>The album was something Wade was ‚Äúextremely nervous to release,‚Äù she told <a href=#>Wonderland Magazine</a> in March 2022, adding, ‚ÄúYou only get one debut, and I had worked really hard on the record. I knew it was a very vulnerable record as well so there was added pressure when I thought about that.‚Äù</p><p>Wade followed up Reckless‚Äô success with a deluxe edition of the album in January 2022. In April of that year, she made her Grand Ole Opry debut in Nashville. Throughout her rise in the music industry, Wade has worked with artists such as <strong>Kip Moore</strong>, <strong>Julia Michaels</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Diplo</strong></a>, in addition to garnering several celebrity fans.</p><p><a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> star <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a> gushed about the ‚ÄúPsychopath‚Äù singer upon meeting for the first time in February 2022. ‚ÄúThe most unlikely of friendships some may think but kinship knows no boundaries üíû,‚Äù she captioned an <a href=#>Instagram</a> pic of them having lunch together with friends.</p><p>Richards later <a href=#>denied rumors that she was dating Wade</a> following <a href=#>her separation</a> from her husband <a href=#><strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a> in July 2023. ‚ÄúWe are very good friends,‚Äù the Bravo star told <a href=#>Page Six</a> at the time, noting that the romantic speculation was ‚Äújust a rumor.‚Äù</p><p>Scroll below for everything you need to know about Wade:</p><h3>1.
