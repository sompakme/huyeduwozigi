Though her personal life has at times been the source of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tabloid interest</a>, she has managed to keep it very private. This is also the case of Sandra's younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, a multi-talented entrepreneur who has been quietly forging her path alongside her famous sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An attorney, film executive, and film producer, Gesine is now a successful pastry chef who divides her time between her baking school and the kitchens of the Food Network, where she is the host of the show Baked in Vermont. Now that we are all back to our kitchens baking bread and looking for inspiration, let's explore everything we know about Sandra Bullock's sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado.</p><h2 id=her-first-career-was-as-a-lawyer><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Her First Career Was As A Lawyer</span></h2><p>Gesine, as did Sandra, was born on the east coast of the United States. However, when her sister Sandra moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, she followed her there. Her sights, however, were set in another path altogether: law.</p><p>She started her studies at the University of Virginia but when she moved to California, she enrolled in Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles. Gesine became an attorney in 1997.</p><h2 id=she-was-also-a-producer-in-sister-sandra-s-film-production-company-fortis-film><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>She&nbsp;Was Also A Producer In Sister Sandra's Film Production Company Fortis Film</span></h2><p>Sandra founded her own production company, Fortis Films, in 1995, and as soon as Gesine was able to practice law, Sandra asked her sister to help her run the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gesine eventually became the company's lawyer and president, and helped develop some of the company's hits starring her sister Sandra, including Miss Congeniality and Miss Congeniality 2, and&nbsp;Practical Magic.&nbsp;She also helped develop the TV series The George Lopez Show.</p><h2 id=despite-being-a-successful-film-executive-in-los-angeles-she-found-herself-slowly-turning-against-her-hollywood-lifestyle><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Despite Being A Successful Film Executive In Los Angeles, She Found Herself Slowly Turning Against Her Hollywood Lifestyle</span></h2><p>In a 2010 interview with NPR, Gesine explained that she knew from very early on she did not fully fit in with the Hollywood lifestyle, but that she still tried to belong, in part because she was lucky to work with her sister.</p><p>"I think I knew the minute I got to Hollywood that it wasn't quite for me. And you're always hoping that you can fit in somehow. And I had my sister and we worked together, so that made it easier, on the one hand - and then, on the other hand, harder to leave," the former lawyer revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Things We Forgot About The Beloved Sandra Bullock</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-2004-she-switched-her-life-from-film-company-president-to-pastry-chef><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>In 2004, She Switched Her Life From Film Company President To Pastry Chef</span></h2><p>Gesine decided to leave Los Angeles in 2004. The move came three years after Gesine and Sandra's mother sadly passed away, which prompted deep soul searching in Gesine and a return to her love of baking.</p><p>As she told The Guardian in 2011, "I'd always been a baker, but it became a ritual of healing for me, and an escape." A trip to Vermont with her husband sealed her destiny as she fell in love with the rural setting far away from the Hollywood glitz and glamour. She enrolled in culinary school and soon after opened her own bakery, Gesine Confectionary.</p><h2 id=she-is-the-host-of-the-food-network-s-baked-in-vermont><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Is The Host Of The Food Network's Baked In Vermont</span></h2><p>In 2017, Gesine added baking show host to her impressive resume when she got her own show on the Food Network.</p><p>The show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baked in Vermont,</a> showcases Gesine's kitchen in her 18th century Vermont farmhouse and focuses on showing "how baking can be easy, accessible and fun." The show has filmed three seasons so far. Gesine is also a regular guest baker in the Today show and a guest editor of&nbsp;Food & Wine and a contributor for&nbsp;Better Homes and Gardens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-the-owner-of-her-own-baking-school-sugar-glider-kitchen><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Is The Owner Of Her Own Baking School,&nbsp;Sugar Glider Kitchen</span></h2><p>After owning her own bakery for several years, Gesine decided to close the shop and establish a baking school in her farmhouse. Gesine has indicated the reason for the transition is that she feels a real love for teaching and sharing her knowledge with others.</p><p>"I felt uncomfortable making people pay for pastries that I just wanted to give away. I would much rather show people what I know and that's where I get great joy," she explained to The Food Network in 2018.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are The Top Shows On The Food Network Today</a></span></p><h2 id=gesine-is-a-prolific-cookbook-author><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Gesine Is A Prolific Cookbook Author</span></h2><p>Gesine has not only brought her baking skills to the Food Network, she has also put in on pastry aficionados' hands through her six baking books, which cover everything from cakes, pies, and pastries to traditional sugar candies and vegan desserts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her first book,&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id=productTitle>My Life from Scratch: A Sweet Journey of Starting Over, One Cake at a Time</span><span id=productTitle>, was published in 2009. The book, part memoir and part cookbook, tells the story of her life-changing decision to leave her career in Hollywood to settle in a quiet Vermont town to bake.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=she-has-a-great-relationship-with-sister-sandra><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Has A Great Relationship With Sister Sandra</span></h2><p>From working together as a team in Fortis Films, to Gesine baking Sandra's wedding cake in 2005, to Sandra <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">putting on an apron and serving pastries</a> when Gesine's bakery in Montpelier, Vermont, first opened, Gesine and Sandra's relationship is one full of love and support.</p><p>Despite now living in different cities, the sisters remain close. This was clear in 2018 when Sandra surprised Gesine during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">baking segment</a> on the Today show: there's genuine surprise, joy, and comfort between the two, even if they are in front of the camera.&nbsp;This is one sweet duo we wouldn't mind seeing more of!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Is Elizabeth Olsen To Her Sisters Mary-Kate And Ashley</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-married-to-raymond-prado-a-storyboard-artist-who-has-worked-on-movies-like-the-hunger-games-and-shows-such-as-stranger-things><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Is Married To Raymond Prado, A Storyboard Artist Who Has Worked On Movies Like "The Hunger Games" And Shows Such As "Stranger Things"</span></h2><p>"He’s supportive and that’s worked in our relationship. We live our own best creative lives with each other, and with each other’s support. I wouldn’t be a pastry chef or an author, and we wouldn’t be living in Vermont if he hadn’t shown me I’m capable," Gesine told The New York Times in 2018.</p><p>Gesine and Raymond met in 1997 while they were both working on a movie, and they married two years later in a ceremony celebrated in Sandra's Texas home. The couple, whose meeting Gesine has described as "one of those lightning bolts, love-at-first-sight moments” never had children but continue to be happily married today.</p><h2 id=gesine-has-found-happiness-and-success-away-from-hollywood><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Gesine&nbsp;Has Found Happiness And Success Away From Hollywood</span></h2><p>While many still dream of Hollywood celebrity and fame, the celebrated cookbook author and TV show host has achieved happiness far away from that world by doing what she truly loves: baking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Honestly, I am so in love with baking, even though it’s my job. When I am not baking for work, I’m baking for pleasure and the people I love. Baked in Vermont really tells that story of how it is my way of truly expressing my love for people and showing them what I love to do," she confessed to The Food Network in 2018.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Normally Very Private Sandra Bullock Showcases Her Daughter To The World</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv8Cnm6uZXZfCrbjOnKKsZaOewLWx0WaenquZo7JurtSlo6ibm2K9s63DqGScoJWberG%2Bzp2snJ2iYrmiw9ieqWaekZjBtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-sandra-bullock-s-sister-everything-we-know-about-gesine-bullock-prado.html&text=Who%20Is%20Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Sister%3f%20Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Gesine%20Bullock-Prado&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-sandra-bullock-s-sister-everything-we-know-about-gesine-bullock-prado.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-sandra-bullock-s-sister-everything-we-know-about-gesine-bullock-prado.html&title=Who%20Is%20Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Sister%3f%20Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Gesine%20Bullock-Prado" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-sandra-bullock-s-sister-everything-we-know-about-gesine-bullock-prado.html&title=Who%20Is%20Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Sister%3f%20Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Gesine%20Bullock-Prado" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-sandra-bullock-s-sister-everything-we-know-about-gesine-bullock-prado.html&title=Who%20Is%20Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Sister%3f%20Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Gesine%20Bullock-Prado" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-sandra-bullock-s-sister-everything-we-know-about-gesine-bullock-prado.html&description=Who%20Is%20Sandra%20Bullock%27s%20Sister%3f%20Everything%20We%20Know%20About%20Gesine%20Bullock-Prado" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brianna-pugh-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brianna Pugh Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-richard-belzer-did-after-law-and-order.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Richard Belzer Did After Law And Order">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
