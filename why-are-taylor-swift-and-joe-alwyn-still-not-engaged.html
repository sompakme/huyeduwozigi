But few romances have lasted longer than her relationship with Joe Alwyn. The singer was rumored to have met the British actor in 2016 at the MET Gala, and within a few months they were reportedly dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Taylor has been open about her romances in the past, she’s done things differently with Joe. Both celebrities decline to speak about their relationship for the most part, preferring to keep their romance private.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where Are Josh And Anna Duggar's Children Currently Living?</a></span></p><p>Nonetheless, there’s been intense speculation over the years about their relationship status, with various reports suggesting they’re engaged. The couple has never confirmed an engagement, but reports suggest it could happen at any time. Here's why we know so far about Joe and Taylor’s plans to get married.</p><h2 id=engagement-rumors-have-followed-joe-amp-taylor-for-years>Engagement Rumors Have Followed Joe & Taylor For Years</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since they were first linked in 2016, engagement rumors have closely been following Joe and Taylor. Fans have been close to analyze the couple’s moves. For example, when Taylor appeared in the Netflix documentary Miss Americana in 2020 while wearing what <a href=#>appeared to be a large diamond on her left hand</a>, fans instantly assumed it was an engagement ring.</p><p>Then, at the beginning of this year, engagement rumors began buzzing again when Life & Style released a report that they’d gotten engaged in secret. The publication said “multiple sources” confirmed the news after the couple took a three-day trip to Cornwall, England.</p><p>Following <a href=#>Life & Style’s</a> claims, other publications came out with reports echoing similar sentiments. One source told <a href=#>The Sun</a> they had only told people in their inner circle. “Basically, immediate family, and trusted, very old friends,” they said. “Everyone has been sworn to secrecy, too.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They continued, “Again, only a handful of people know details about the wedding and Taylor hasn’t even told some of her team about the engagement.”</p><p>The insider also explained why Joe and Taylor are reportedly hiding their engagement from the public. The famous couple apparently want to enjoy the big milestone in private, away from the scrutiny of the public’s eye.</p><p>The source also said that their future wedding is likely going to be just as secretive.</p><p>“They want their love to stay away from the cameras as much as possible,” they said. “This is just for them. And if and when they do exchange vows, there most definitely won’t be any Vogue, Rolling Stone or Hello! magazines there. It will be simple and elegant — like them.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Gigi Hadid’s Most High-Profile Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-finally-addressed-the-speculation-earlier-this-year>Joe Finally Addressed The Speculation Earlier This Year</h2><p>Joe and Taylor are notoriously private about their personal lives. They rarely discuss their relationship, let alone post about each other online. Paparazzi photos of the long-time couple are also difficult to find.</p><p>However, the engagement rumors appeared to get to Joe earlier this year when he addressed the speculation. But the actor didn’t outright deny their plans for marriage.</p><p>Rather, Joe emphasized that both he and Taylor crave their privacy.</p><p>“ <a href=#>If I had a pound for every time</a> I think I’ve been told I’ve been engaged, then I’d have a lot of pound coins,” he told WSJ Magazine. “I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the first time Joe has confronted the speculation in an interview. He did the same in 2018 when speaking to Vogue. Instead of offering any insight into his romance with Taylor, Joe said he prefers to keep his media interviews professional and focused on work.</p><p>“I’m aware people want to know about that side of things,” he explained. “I think we have been successfully very private and that has now sunk in for people […] but I really prefer to talk about work.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Justin Bieber's 12 Biggest Scandals</a></span></p><h2 id=joe-amp-taylor-want-to-get-married-but-they-rsquo-re-in-no-rush>Joe & Taylor Want To Get Married, But They’re In No Rush</h2><p>Despite the little they talk about each other, Joe and Taylor seem head over heels for each other.
