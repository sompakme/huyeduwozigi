Luckily for Gabriel, his career took off with a lot of hard work and determination, landing himself on six episodes of Nickelodeon's, All That back in 2000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Fluffy has become one of the biggest stand-up comics to date, joining the ranks of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Chapelle</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea Handler</a>, to name a few. In addition to his on-stage career, Gabriel Iglesias also scored himself a number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix comedy specials</a>, including One Show Fits All and The Fluffy Movie.</p><p>Despite his career and passion for comedy being front and center, Gabriel has always kept his personal life very private, especially when it comes to his relationships! So, why has Fluffy kept his romances on the down-low?

The comedian got his big break back in the late 90s when he moved up to Los Angeles from his hometown of San Diego.</p><p>Although the comic found himself struggling at first, ultimately leading him to be evicted and lose his car, that didn't stop Gabriel from keeping his eye on the prize. After building a name for himself in the stand-up comedy scene, Fluffy managed to score himself his first television show!</p><p>In 2000, Iglesias was cast on six episodes of the Nickelodeon series, All That, which starred Kenan Thompson, and Kel Mitchell.</p><p>This landed Fluffy with an array of TV roles, including voice roles for Family Guy, Emperor's New Groove, and appearances on the big screen in films such as Magic Mike, and Haunted House 2, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star went on to become one of the biggest names in comedy, amassing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $40 million!</a> This became possible with his on-stage routines, however, Gabriel Iglesias struck gold with his many film leads including Hey It's Fluffy!, I'm Not Fat...I'm Fluffy, and his own Netflix special, The Comedy Event, which is set to air later this year.</p><p>Although he has lived a very public life when it comes to his career, Gabriel has always kept his romantic life away from the limelight. While we know Iglesias is a father, many don't know too much about his love life!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern Never Became A Stand-Up Comic</a></span></p><h2 id=is-gabriel-iglesias-in-a-relationship>Is Gabriel Iglesias In A Relationship?</h2><p>Although Gabriel Iglesias is currently single, that wasn't always the case.

Valdez also had a son from a previous marriage, Frankie, who was born back in 1997. Gabriel revealed that he adopted Frankie, allowing the trio to live as a family in Whitter, California.</p><p>Frankie became a bit in a number of Fluffy's routines, including stories touching on the many laughs and heartaches that come with being a father! While Frankie is still very much involved in Gabriel's life, Fluffy and Claudia officially ended things last year after 12 years together.</p><p>Although Gabriel Iglesias nor Claudia ever gave a reason regarding their split, it appears as if Fluffy's time battling depression and alcoholism played a role in affecting his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, the comics life came to a standstill when he had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very public breakdown on stage </a>during a show. With years of constant touring, appearing in countless film and TV shows, all while suffering from depression and issues surrounding substance abuse, it was clear that it was time to take a break.</p><p>Luckily for Gabriel, the comedian kept fans in on his journey to sobriety and a much healthier mental state, all while sharing this his overall health including his diabetes, was improving tremendously.</p><p>While Gabriel kept hush on the reason behind his and Claudia's split, fans figured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things came to a boil between the two</a>, especially during the darker days, and things simply didn't work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gabriel doesn't seem very adamant about jumping into a relationship anytime soon, however, his next romance will most likely remain very private, considering his former romance didn't stand the test of time in the spotlight.</p><p>Today, Gabriel is back at it with his stand-up, TV appearances, and his Tapatio hot sauce collaboration! More recently, Fluffy appeared on ABC's The Celebrity Dating Game, all while readying his 2021 world tour, which is set to start on August 5th in Charlotte!</p><p>With so much happening in Fluffy's career, it's&nbsp;safe to say that his love life is the last of his worries, especially considering his breakup is still quite fresh!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Truth About How Ricky Gervais Writes Comedy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLyuscOimKdll5avs7XEpWSin5yawKqt0mainp2gqHqptdJmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpq12lv6rCwK2caA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html&text=Why%20Comedian%20Gabriel%20Iglesias%20Keeps%20His%20Relationships%20Private&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html&title=Why%20Comedian%20Gabriel%20Iglesias%20Keeps%20His%20Relationships%20Private" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html&title=Why%20Comedian%20Gabriel%20Iglesias%20Keeps%20His%20Relationships%20Private" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html&title=Why%20Comedian%20Gabriel%20Iglesias%20Keeps%20His%20Relationships%20Private" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-comedian-gabriel-iglesias-keeps-his-relationships-private.html&description=Why%20Comedian%20Gabriel%20Iglesias%20Keeps%20His%20Relationships%20Private" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-things-you-didn-t-know-about-peta-wilson-what-is-she-doing-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Things You Didnt Know About Peta Wilson, What Is She Doing Now?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-lady-gaga-s-plastic-surgery-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Lady Gaga's Plastic Surgery Rumors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
