Let’s break it down in this week’s edition of Women’s Wrestling Wrap-Up!</p><h4></h4><p>NXT Halloween Havoc saw multiple new champions emerge within the women’s division last week, including all three members of Toxic Attraction walking away with NXT gold.</p><p>Firstly, the NXT Women’s Tag Team Championship was on the line in a Scareway To Hell ladder match. Reigning champions, Io Shirai and Zoey Stark, attempted to fend off two other teams in an intense, and quite scary triple threat ladder bout. Indi Hartwell and Persia Pirotta combined their agility and strength, while Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne utilized their cunningness to their advantage.</p><p>There was certainly a fair display of ladder bumps taken in this matchup, including when Persia Pirotta aggressively powerbombed Gigi Dolin through a ladder. Io Shirai landed a flying moonsault through one as well, before later taking a brutal crash to the outside after Indi Hartell tipped her off of another ladder. In the end, however, Hartwell was met by Gigi Dolin atop a ladder in the center of the ring.</p><p>Dolin managed to force Hartwell to the ground with a series of blows, before unhooking the titles to secure the victory for her team, Toxic Attraction. This win dethrones the now-former champions, Shirai and Stark, who had held the championships since July. Toxic Attraction now holds the NXT Women’s Tag Team Championships after that brutal Scareway To Hell Ladder Match win.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>? ? ?</p><p>they told you so. <a href=#>#AndNew</a> <a href=#>#ToxicAttraction</a> <a href=#>#WWENXT</a> <a href=#>#HalloweenHavoc</a> @WWE_MandyRose <a href=#>@gigidolin_wwe</a> <a href=#>@jacyjaynewwe</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GZBSTs2SNV</a></p><p>— WWE NXT (@WWENXT) <a href=#>October 27, 2021</a></p><p>But Toxic Attraction’s desire for gold didn’t stop there.</p><p>Later in the evening, Toxic Attraction leader <a href=#>Mandy Rose</a> earned herself an NXT Women’s Championship opportunity against reigning champion, Raquel Gonzalez.</p><p>Gonzalez won her championship back in April, defeating Io Shirai at NXT Takeover: Stand & Deliver. She would reach a dominant run with victories over the likes of Franky Monet, Xia Li, Ember Moon, and most notably, Dakota Kai. For over six months, Gonzalez controlled and ran right through nearly all of the NXT women’s division, until Mandy Rose returned to the brand.</p><p>On July 13th, Rose formally returned to NXT, scouting a match between Sarray and Gigi Dolin. The next week, she appeared ringside to witness Jacy Jayne take on Franky Monet. Dolin and Jayne would go on to link up and form a formidable tag team, before accompanying Mandy Rose to her match against Sarray on August 31st. Together, the three women established themselves as a forceful trio known as Toxic Attraction.</p><p>Last week on the Halloween Havoc edition of NXT 2.0, Mandy Rose collided with the dominant Raquel Gonzalez in a “Trick Or Street” fight match type, as declared by Chucky the doll. This fight saw the usage of fire extinguishers, kendo sticks, steel chairs, and a wide variety of foreign objects. Rose gained the upper hand by launching Gonzalez into the steel steps before Gonzalez returned the favor by spearing Rose through a table. Before Gonzalez could capitalize on the move, a hooded grim reaper appeared behind her with a shovel in hand.</p><p>The hooded figure wailed the shovel into Gonzalez’s back, knocking the now former champion down. This act allowed Rose the window of opportunity to secure the pinfall on Gonzalez, and thus, ending Gonzalez’s championship stretch. Mandy Rose celebrated her newly claimed NXT Women’s Championship with the previously crowned NXT Women’s Tag Team Champions, Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne, on the entrance ramp.</p><p>Toxic Attraction now holds all the available women’s championship gold on the NXT brand.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>About time.</p><p>@WWE_MandyRose is your new TOXIC <a href=#>#WWENXT</a> <a href=#>#WomensChampion</a>. ? <a href=#>#HalloweenHavoc</a> <a href=#>#NXTWomensTitle</a> <a href=#>#AndNew</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yLS3VVWdSV</a></p><p>— WWE NXT (@WWENXT) <a href=#>October 27, 2021</a></p><p><a href=#>Mandy Rose Wins NXT Women’s Title In ‘Trick Or Street Fight’ With Help From Dakota Kai</a></p><p>Meanwhile, the hooded grim reaper revealed herself to be Gonzalez’s former alliance member, <a href=#>Dakota Kai</a>. Kai was last seen on WWE programming at NXT Takeover 36 in August, where she lost a match for the NXT Women’s Championship against the former champion.</p><p>With Kai not selected for RAW or Smackdown in the recent WWE draft, her future in WWE was previously unknown. Now, she has seemingly returned to NXT with some unfinished business with her former friend, now turned foe, Raquel Gonzalez. Viewers look to secure some answers from this newly revitalized Dakota Kai.</p><p>Perhaps, we’ll get some this week on NXT 2.0.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SHE'S BACK!!!!!!!!<a href=#>@DakotaKai_WWE</a> with a HUGE hand in <a href=#>@RaquelWWE</a>'s title loss ?<a href=#>#WWENXT</a> <a href=#>#HalloweenHavoc</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hXXb8WXsdL</a></p><p>— WWE on BT Sport (@btsportwwe) <a href=#>October 27, 2021</a></p><h4>Rok-C Forges Impressive Path As ROH Women’s Champion</h4><p>Despite the recent Ring of Honor news of a hiatus and contract releases, some light should be shed on the notable run that ROH Women’s World Champion, Rok-C, has achieved thus far.</p><p>“The Prodigy” will be defending her Ring of Honor Women’s World Championship at Final Battle in December, but she’s also already successfully defended it an impressive four times outside of the ROH<br>scope.</p><p>On September 25th, Killer Kelly challenged Rok-C for the ROH Women’s World Championship at New Texas Pro Wrestling.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watch <a href=#>@TheRokC_</a> vs. <a href=#>@Kelly_WP</a> for the <a href=#>@NewTexasPW</a> & <a href=#>@ringofhonor</a> Women's Championships from <a href=#>@NewTexasPW</a> last event "Olajuwon" now available on YouTube.</p><p>Link<a href=#>https://t.co/hPn81LmClV</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BINZaiPUW4</a></p><p>— Bryant D.

Rok-C would emerge victoriously and remain the titleholder of both respective championships, but not without a valiant effort from Rose.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>First Woman’s Match of the night <a href=#>@NewTexasPW</a> <a href=#>#HocusPocus</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Llvnhpq0Bt</a></p><p>— Random Ramblings w/Rob (@3RShow) <a href=#>October 31, 2021</a></p><p>Rok-C recently earned herself the #28 slot on the PWI Women’s 150 list, as further proof of her impressive work ethic. As the youngest champion in the history of Ring of Honor, “The Prodigy” has showcased her strong abilities to perform in and outside of the ring. Rok-C will thrive in whatever ventures she pursues during this upcoming hiatus.</p><p>Until then, she remains the ROH Women’s World Champion ahead of Final Battle.</p><h4></h4><p>The tournament to crown the first-ever TBS Champion continued on AEW programming last week.</p><p>On last week’s edition of Dynamite, Serena Deeb and <a href=#>Hikaru Shida</a> faced off in a high-profile first-round matchup. Shida emerged with the victory, marking her fiftieth win in All Elite Wrestling. That win celebration was cut short though, as Deeb viciously beat down Shida post-match. Nevertheless, Shida advanced to the second round of the tournament. She’ll next take on former AEW Women’s Champion, Nyla Rose, who qualified with a first-round bye.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>That's win No. 50 for <a href=#>@shidahikaru</a> and she moves on in the TBS Women's Championship Tournament!
