But this was not George's only heart-related ailment during the series. Young Sheldon also teased George’s demise through heart failure during season 5 during his brief emotional affair with their neighbor, Brenda Sparks.</p><p>In the season 5 premiere, Brenda makes an indecent proposal to George, which <strong>leads to his second mini-heart attack. </strong>Despite George living a relatively healthy life since then, he had a <a href=#>heart attack off-screen during season 7,</a> which led to his untimely death.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:24</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_the-breakdown-of-sheldon-cooper-s-parents-paves-the-way-for-young-sheldon-s-biggest-tragedy_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Breakdown Of Sheldon Cooper's Parents Paves The Way For Young Sheldon's Biggest Tragedy">The Breakdown Of Sheldon Cooper's Parents Paves The Way For Young Sheldon's Biggest Tragedy</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Young Sheldon season 7 is planting seeds of distaste in George and Mary Cooper's marriage, which may be a way to prepare for the unavoidable tragedy.</p><h2 id=why-young-sheldon-waited-until-the-very-end-for-george-cooper-39-s-exit>Why Young Sheldon Waited Until The Very End For George Cooper's Exit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_young-sheldon-photos-of-the-cast-then-vs-now_bk_a1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young Sheldon teased George Cooper's death a few times throughout the series, but they waited until the end of the final season to do it.

However, the creators also didn't want George's death to be the last image on viewers' minds when the show ended after seven years.</p><p>The show's executive producer, Steve Holland, told Deadline that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the timing of George's death had been discussed in the earlier seasons,</a> and they knew they wanted to do it sometime in the final episodes of their last season.</p><p>"Chuck Lore said the show has been a positive, loving family show.
